  "text": "UOR Pan-Coherentism represents a comprehensive philosophical worldview that emerges from the Universal Object Reference framework. This perspective advances a unified theory of reality where mind, matter, mathematics, and metaphysics are understood not as separate domains but as different facets of a single underlying coherence geometry.\n\nAt its core, pan-coherentism proposes that all phenomena—whether physical, mental, or abstract—are manifestations of coherence relations in prime-coordinate space. Rather than privileging either material or mental aspects of reality as fundamental, it suggests that both emerge from more basic coherence structures. This positions the framework as a form of neutral monism, but one with a specific mathematical formalism for understanding the common substrate.\n\nThe concept extends to social and cultural phenomena as well. Societies and languages are understood to evolve toward optimizing the coherence of shared information, with memes functioning as prime units that minimize conceptual complexity. Cultural evolution thus represents a collective exploration of coherence space, with successful cultural innovations representing coherence-reducing insights that spread through populations.\n\nEvolution and artificial intelligence are similarly unified under this perspective. Learning systems, whether biological or artificial, progress by reducing coherence norms, mirroring how natural selection drives towards efficient genetic and behavioral encodings. This suggests a continuity between biological adaptation, cognitive development, and machine learning, all understood as different manifestations of coherence optimization in their respective domains.\n\nThis philosophical vision has significant implications for consciousness science, epistemology, and the integration of scientific disciplines. By providing a common mathematical language (coherence geometry) for phenomena traditionally studied in isolation, it suggests new approaches to interdisciplinary problems and potentially resolves traditional philosophical dichotomies like mind/body dualism or the apparent gap between physical and mathematical reality.\n\nUltimately, pan-coherentism suggests that understanding emerges from locating minimal-norm representations in prime-coordinate space. Truth, in this framework, isn't correspondence to an external reality but rather the identification of maximally coherent representations. This aligns with but extends beyond coherentist theories of truth in traditional epistemology, grounding coherence in the specific mathematical structure of prime coordinates and their associated norms.",
