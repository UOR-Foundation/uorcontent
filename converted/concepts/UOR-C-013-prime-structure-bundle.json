  "sourceText": "The first level of the UOR bundle hierarchy focuses on the intrinsic prime structure. Its base space is the set of intrinsic primes P with the discrete topology. The fiber is the valuation group ℤ given by prime exponents, or ℤ₊ in purely integral contexts. The total space E₁ = ⊔_{p∈P} {p} × ℤ contains pairs (p,a) where p is a prime and a is its exponent. The projection π₁: E₁ → P is defined by π₁(p,a) = p, forgetting the exponent. For an object X, its section s_X: P → E₁ is given by s_X(p) = (p, φ(X)(p)), mapping each prime to its exponent in X.",
