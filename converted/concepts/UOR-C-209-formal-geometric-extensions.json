  "text": "UOR Geometric Extensions encompass a broad collection of mathematical formalisms that extend the Universal Object Reference framework to continuous, curved, and infinite-dimensional spaces. These extensions interpret prime-coordinate structures through the languages of differential geometry, fiber bundle theory, functional analysis, and computational frameworks, demonstrating how UOR principles manifest in geometric settings.\n\nDifferential Geometric extensions apply UOR to manifolds and other smooth spaces. Prime-coordinate differential forms, defined as dφ(X) = ∑_p d(v_p(X)) ∧ d log(p), measure infinitesimal changes in prime coordinates across manifolds. Connection forms ω_φ = ∑_p dv_p(X) ⊗ e_p, where e_p is a basis element for the fiber over prime p, characterize how prime coordinates transform during parallel transport. The curvature tensor R_φ = dω_φ + ω_φ ∧ ω_φ measures the failure of prime coordinates to commute when transported along different paths. Symplectic structures ω = ∑_p dv_p ∧ dp_p introduce canonical phase-space structures on prime coordinates, while Riemannian metrics g_φ = ∑_{p,q} g_{pq} dv_p ⊗ dv_q define geometries on prime-coordinate manifolds. These formulations connect UOR to the rich framework of modern differential geometry, revealing prime-coordinate spaces as geometric objects with intrinsic curvature and structure.\n\nFiber Bundle Theory provides a geometric framework where the observer aspects of UOR are formalized. The frame bundle forms a principal G-bundle P_φ = {(X, r) | X ∈ Obj, r ∈ R_X}, where G acts on the right as frame transformations. Associated vector bundles E_φ,ρ = P_φ ×_G V_ρ arise from representations of the frame group. Jet bundles J^k(φ) = {(X, j^k_X(φ)) | X ∈ Obj} capture higher derivatives of prime coordinates. Ehresmann connections Γ: TP_φ → g split tangent spaces into horizontal and vertical components, while holonomy groups Hol_x(Γ) measure path-dependent effects in observer frames. This bundle-theoretic perspective illuminates the deep relationship between observers, reference frames, and the intrinsic structure of prime coordinates, connecting UOR to gauge theories and modern geometric perspectives on physics.\n\nFunctional Analytic extensions bring UOR into infinite-dimensional spaces. The prime-coordinate space completes to a Hilbert space H_φ = L^2(Spec(R), μ), where μ is a measure on the prime spectrum. Creation and annihilation operators a_p†|v⟩ = |v+e_p⟩ and a_p|v⟩ = v_p|v-e_p⟩ manipulate prime-coordinate states. Spectral theory relates operators to their eigenvalue decompositions φ(A)|v⟩ = λ_v|v⟩, where λ_v depends on the prime structure of v. Banach algebra generalizations extend to φ_B(x) = {(p, v_p(x)) | p ∈ Prim(B)}, where Prim(B) is the space of primitive ideals. Distribution theory introduces generalized functions through relations like ⟨φ'(X), ψ⟩ = -⟨φ(X), ψ'⟩. These approaches connect UOR to functional analysis, operator theory, and quantum mechanics, revealing how prime-coordinate structures manifest in infinite-dimensional settings.\n\nComputational and Logical extensions formalize UOR in computational frameworks. Type-theoretic formulations express prime coordinates as dependent functions φ : (X : Obj) → Σ(p : Prime), ℕ, providing constructive foundations. Proof-theoretic interpretations decompose proofs as φ_proof(π) = {(α, n_α) | α axiom used n_α times in π}. Algorithmic complexity relates to Kolmogorov complexity K(x) ≈ ∑_p v_p(x) · log(p). Modal logic extensions track possible prime valuations as φ_◊(X) = {(p, ◊v_p(X)) | p ∈ P}, while fuzzy logic treats prime relevance with degrees φ_fuzzy(X)(p) ∈ [0,1]. These approaches connect UOR to foundations of mathematics, theoretical computer science, and non-classical logics.",
