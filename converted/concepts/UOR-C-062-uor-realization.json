Intrinsic Primes: Prime numbers serve as the atomic, irreducible elements of the system\n2. Unique Factorization: Every universal number admits a unique representation in terms of prime components\n3. Prime-Coordinate Homomorphism: The mapping œÜ: ùïå ‚Üí ‚ÑÇ^‚àû transforms multiplication to coordinate addition\n4. Canonical Representation: The coordinate representation provides a minimal, observer-invariant encoding\n5. Coherence Metrics: The universal metric induces norms that measure representational complexity\n6. Inner Product Structure: The coordinate space supports inner products aligning with coherence principles\n7. Trilateral Coherence: Structure (primes), dynamics (operations), and observer frames (metrics) integrate coherently\n\nThis realization proves that the abstract UOR principles can be concretely implemented in a rigorous mathematical system with powerful computational properties."
