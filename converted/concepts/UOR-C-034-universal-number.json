  "sourceText": "Universal numbers represent a fundamental extension beyond traditional number systems, unifying the properties of real, complex, and p-adic numbers within a computable framework while maintaining complete consistency with the UOR prime-coordinate axioms.\n\nWith these axioms established, we formally define the field of universal numbers:\n\nùïå = {Œ∑ | Œ∑ admits a unique prime-coordinate representation œÜ(Œ∑) = (e‚ÇÅ, e‚ÇÇ, e‚ÇÉ, ...) that is computably approximable in all relevant metrics}\n\nThis definition extends traditional numbers by allowing:\n\n1. Complex prime exponents: Unlike integers where prime exponents must be natural numbers, universal numbers permit complex-valued exponents that maintain algebraic consistency\n2. Multi-metric completeness: Unlike traditional number systems that privilege either the Archimedean or non-Archimedean metric, universal numbers maintain completeness under both\n3. Computable representation: All universal numbers have explicit algorithmic representations"
