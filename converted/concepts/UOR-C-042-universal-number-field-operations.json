  "sourceText": "Universal numbers form a field with precisely defined operations that extend the fundamental operations on prime-coordinates:\n\nFor universal numbers `Œ±, Œ≤ ‚àà ùïå` with prime-coordinate representations `œÜ(Œ±) = (a‚ÇÅ, a‚ÇÇ, ...)` and `œÜ(Œ≤) = (b‚ÇÅ, b‚ÇÇ, ...)`:\n\n1. Addition: `œÜ(Œ± + Œ≤) = log(exp(œÜ(Œ±)) + exp(œÜ(Œ≤)))`\n   Where exp and log operate componentwise on the prime-coordinate vectors\n\n2. Multiplication: `œÜ(Œ± ¬∑ Œ≤) = œÜ(Œ±) + œÜ(Œ≤)`\n   Direct vector addition in the prime-coordinate space\n\n3. Additive Inverse: `œÜ(-Œ±) = log(exp(0) - exp(œÜ(Œ±)))`\n   Where 0 represents the zero vector in coordinate space\n\n4. Multiplicative Inverse: `œÜ(Œ±‚Åª¬π) = -œÜ(Œ±)`\n   Negation of each coordinate in the prime-coordinate representation\n\nThese operations satisfy the field axioms and maintain consistency with both complex and p-adic interpretations."
