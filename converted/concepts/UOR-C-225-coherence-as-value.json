  "text": "Coherence as Value represents a revolutionary approach to axiology—the study of value—within the UOR framework. This principle establishes that ethical and aesthetic values, traditionally treated as either subjective preferences or transcendent ideals, are in fact objectively grounded in coherence principles that can be precisely formulated in terms of prime-coordinate representations. Beauty, goodness, and other values emerge not as arbitrary constructs but as natural manifestations of coherence optimization across multiple observer frames.\n\nAesthetic value, according to this principle, corresponds directly to optimal information compression in prime-coordinate space. Beauty arises when a pattern achieves maximum representational efficiency—expressing significant complexity through minimal prime factors. This explains why certain mathematical equations, musical harmonies, artistic compositions, and natural forms strike us as inherently beautiful: they represent optimal coherence in their respective domains. The elegant mathematical expression E = mc² is beautiful precisely because it compresses profound physical complexity into a simple relation between prime elements. Similarly, great art achieves beauty by capturing complex human experience through elegantly coherent representation.\n\nMoral value emerges from coherence preservation across multiple observer frames. Good actions are those that maintain or enhance coherence across diverse perspectives, while harmful actions diminish coherence by creating contradictions between frames. This framework provides a precise mathematical grounding for ethical principles like the Golden Rule and Kant's categorical imperative, showing they emerge naturally from coherence optimization across observer frames. Justice, compassion, and other moral virtues represent different aspects of coherence preservation in social systems.\n\nThis approach resolves traditional meta-ethical dilemmas. It avoids both relativism (by grounding values in objective coherence properties) and absolutism (by recognizing that optimal coherence varies with context). Values are neither purely subjective projections nor transcendent ideals, but emerge from the mathematics of coherence preservation in complex information systems. This explains why certain values appear consistently across cultures while others vary with social context—they reflect universal and local coherence optima, respectively.\n\nThe principle has profound implications for normative ethics and aesthetic theory. It suggests that ethical progress consists in developing social systems that achieve greater coherence across more diverse observer frames. Beauty in art and design emerges from achieving optimal trade-offs between complexity and simplicity, with masterpieces representing unique prime-coordinate optima in their expressive spaces. The aesthetic and ethical converge in this framework, as both ultimately reflect aspects of the same underlying coherence principles.\n\nCoherence as Value also provides a foundation for addressing contemporary ethical challenges. Environmental ethics can be reformulated in terms of coherence preservation across ecological systems and timeframes. Technological ethics can evaluate innovations by their impact on coherence across affected frames. Social justice becomes the pursuit of institutional arrangements that maximize coherence across diverse human perspectives, explaining why unjust systems are both morally wrong and pragmatically unstable.\n\nThis principle transforms our understanding of values from a domain ostensibly separate from facts to an integral aspect of reality's coherent information structure. Values aren't arbitrary human constructs projected onto a value-neutral reality, but reflect objective patterns of coherence that emerge naturally from prime-coordinate structures. The ancient philosophical quest to ground values in reality achieves fulfillment through the mathematics of coherence optimization across observer frames.",
