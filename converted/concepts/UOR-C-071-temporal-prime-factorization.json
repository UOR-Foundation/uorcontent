Homomorphism: φ_T(D_1 ∘ D_2) = φ_T(D_1) + φ_T(D_2)\n2. Composition: If D = D_1 ∘ D_2, then ∏_p p^(φ_T(D)(p)) = ∏_p p^(φ_T(D_1)(p)) ∘ ∏_p p^(φ_T(D_2)(p))\n3. Identity: φ_T(I) = 0, where I is the identity process\n4. Inverse: φ_T(D^(-1)) = -φ_T(D)\n\nThese properties ensure that the temporal prime decomposition preserves the algebraic structure of dynamical systems."
