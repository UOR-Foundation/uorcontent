  "sourceText": "The prime-coordinate functor possesses a universal property that characterizes it uniquely:\n- Universal Linearization: For any functor F: Obj → A from objects to an abelian category A satisfying F(X ⊗ Y) = F(X) ⊕ F(Y), there exists a unique natural transformation α: φ → F.\n- Universal Factorization: Formally, for any additive functor H: Mod → A, we have F = H ∘ φ, making φ the universal factorization of any additive representation of Obj.\n- Terminal Property: In the category of homomorphisms from (Obj, ⊗) to abelian groups, φ is terminal.\n- Universal Logarithm: The prime-coordinate functor serves as the universal logarithm, transforming multiplicative structures into additive ones through the formula: log(X ⊗ Y) = log(X) + log(Y), where log = φ in the UOR context."
