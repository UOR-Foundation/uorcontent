Composition Invariance: Multiple conversions can be composed without information degradation: `C_m→p ∘ C_n→m = C_n→p`.\n\n2. Reversibility: Conversions are reversible, meaning `C_m→n ∘ C_n→m(B) = B` for any block `B`.\n\n3. Format Agnosticism: The same principle applies regardless of the specific encoding formats (binary, hexadecimal, base-64, etc.).\n\n4. Scale Invariance: Conversion properties remain consistent regardless of the absolute scale of the bit-widths involved.\n\n5. Domain Independence: The conversion mechanism operates independently of the specific domain or application context."
