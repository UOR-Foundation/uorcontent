  "sourceText": "A fiber bundle (E, B, π, F, G) consists of a total space E, a base space B, a projection π: E → B mapping each point to its base, a typical fiber F (the space attached to each point in B), a structure group G (transformations of F preserving bundle structure), and local trivializations. The UOR framework achieves its full mathematical power through a hierarchical fiber bundle formulation that rigorously integrates object structure with observer perspectives.",
