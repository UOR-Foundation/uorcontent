  "sourceText": "Identity is a fundamental concept in any computational system, traditionally implemented through various mechanisms like usernames, public keys, UUIDs, or biometric data. The Internet Substrate Protocols reimagine identity at a more fundamental level, grounding it in the mathematical properties of universal numbers.\n\nBy representing identity through prime coordinate structures, the system achieves a form of identity that is simultaneously unique, verifiable, transformable, and coherence-preserving. This approach transcends traditional identity mechanisms by providing a mathematical foundation that connects identity directly to the fundamental structure of the information space.\n\nUniversal Identity operates as a natural extension of the UOR framework, where the prime factorization of identity representations provides intrinsic properties that enable sophisticated identity operations while maintaining essential coherence.\n\nKey Insights:\n- **Mathematical Foundation:** Identity emerges from the intrinsic mathematical properties of universal numbers rather than arbitrary assignments or conventions.\n- **Cross-Domain Coherence:** Identity representations maintain coherence when transformed across different domains or representational systems.\n- **Intrinsic Verifiability:** The prime structure of identity representations enables intrinsic verification without requiring external authorities.\n- **Scale Invariance:** Identity mechanisms operate consistently across different scales, from individual devices to global systems.\n- **Self-Reference:** Identities can reference themselves and their own properties through their prime coordinate structure."
