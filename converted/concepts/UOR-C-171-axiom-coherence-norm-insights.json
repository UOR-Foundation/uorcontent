  "text": "The Coherence Norm Axiom yields several profound insights that illuminate the nature of representational complexity and simplicity:\n\n1. Objective Simplicity: The coherence norm provides a mathematical definition of \"simplicity\" that aligns with intuitionâ€”simpler structures have lower norms. This transforms the subjective notion of simplicity into an objective, measurable quantity. Objects composed of fewer distinct primes or with smaller exponents will have smaller coherence norms, reflecting their simpler structure. This objective measure of simplicity allows for rigorous comparisons of complexity across different objects and domains, replacing subjective judgments with precise calculations.\n\n2. Pythagorean Principle: By the properties of Euclidean norms, any non-prime grouping of factors increases the total norm, proving that prime factorization is minimal. This insight leverages the Pythagorean theorem in the coordinate space: if we were to represent an object using non-prime factors (which would themselves be products of primes), the resulting coordinate representation would have a larger norm due to the Pythagorean relationship between the original prime coordinates and the combined coordinates. This provides a mathematical proof that the prime factorization truly achieves minimal complexity among all possible representations.\n\n3. Information Metric: The coherence norm can be interpreted as measuring the information content of an object's structure. Under this interpretation, the norm quantifies the minimum amount of information needed to specify the object's composition. Smaller norms correspond to objects that require less information to define completely. This creates a bridge between the UOR framework and information theory, suggesting that prime factorization is not just structurally optimal but also informationally optimal.\n\nThese insights reveal that the coherence norm is not just a mathematical tool but a fundamental principle with far-reaching implications. It provides the quantitative foundation for claims about representational optimality and creates a rigorous framework for understanding structural complexity across domains.\n\nBy equipping the prime coordinate space with this norm, the UOR framework transforms abstract assertions about simplicity and canonicity into provable mathematical facts, grounding the intuitive concept of \"natural representation\" in precise metric geometry.",
