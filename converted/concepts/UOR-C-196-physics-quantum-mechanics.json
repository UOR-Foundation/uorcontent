  "text": "The UOR Quantum Mechanics concept reinterprets quantum phenomena through the prime-coordinate framework, offering novel perspectives on foundational quantum principles while maintaining mathematical consistency with established quantum theory.\n\nQuantum states are represented as probability distributions over prime-coordinate configurations, with the wavefunction expressed as ψ(φ) = A·e^{iS(φ)/ħ}, where S(φ) is the action in prime-coordinate space and A is a normalization constant. This formulation directly connects quantum probability amplitudes to the action principle in prime space.\n\nThe Schrödinger equation, which governs the time evolution of quantum systems, takes the form iħ ∂ψ(φ)/∂t = -ħ²/2m ∇²_φ ψ(φ) + V(φ)ψ(φ), where ∇²_φ is the Laplacian in prime-coordinate space and V(φ) is the potential. This demonstrates how quantum dynamics can be naturally expressed in the language of prime coordinates.\n\nThe Uncertainty Principle, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, finds expression as Δp · Δφ ≥ ħ/2, where Δp and Δφ represent uncertainties in canonical conjugate variables of momentum and position in prime space. This formulation reveals how the uncertainty principle emerges from the fundamental structure of prime-coordinate space.\n\nQuantum entanglement, one of the most counterintuitive aspects of quantum mechanics, is represented as non-local correlations between prime-coordinate representations: |ψ⟩ = (1/√2)(|φ_A⟩|φ_B⟩ + |φ'_A⟩|φ'_B⟩), where different prime configurations become correlated. This formulation provides insights into how seemingly separate systems can exhibit non-local correlations through their prime-coordinate representations.\n\nElementary particles find representation as irreducible prime patterns, with examples such as φ(e) = e_p (unit vector along a specific prime direction) and φ(γ) = 0 (photon as the identity element). Composite particles are represented as prime-coordinate combinations, such as φ(proton) = φ(uud) = 2φ(u) + φ(d), where u and d represent up and down quarks.",
