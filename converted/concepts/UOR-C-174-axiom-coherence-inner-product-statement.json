  "text": "The Coherence Inner Product Axiom is formally stated as: \"Define ⟨v,w⟩ = ∑_p v(p)·w(p), making the exponent space a Euclidean vector space with orthonormal prime axes.\"\n\nThis axiom introduces a fundamental geometric structure to the prime coordinate space by defining an inner product operation. The inner product is a function that takes two prime coordinate vectors and returns a scalar value, providing a measure of their correlation or similarity. For any two vectors v and w in the prime coordinate space ℤ^(P), their inner product is defined as the sum of products of their corresponding components across all prime dimensions.\n\nThe statement contains several critical components:\n\n1. Mathematical Definition: The formula ⟨v,w⟩ = ∑_p v(p)·w(p) specifies precisely how to calculate the inner product by summing the products of corresponding components across all prime dimensions p.\n\n2. Euclidean Vector Space: By equipping the prime coordinate space with this inner product, the axiom transforms it into a full Euclidean vector space, enabling the application of rich geometric concepts like distances, angles, and projections.\n\n3. Orthonormal Prime Axes: The statement specifically notes that the prime axes form an orthonormal system, meaning that different primes represent completely independent dimensions of structure with no overlap or correlation between them.\n\nAs the sixth of the eight core UOR axioms, the Coherence Inner Product builds directly on the Coherence Norm Axiom, extending it from a simple measure of \"size\" to a complete geometric structure that captures relationships between different objects. This axiom elevates the prime coordinate system from a purely algebraic tool to a geometric framework that reveals deep structural patterns and relationships.",
