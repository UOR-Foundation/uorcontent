  "sourceText": "The central insight of UOR is that prime factorization provides a natural, intrinsic coordinate system for objects: Every object has a unique factorization into irreducible components. This factorization reveals the object's inherent structure. The prime-coordinate representation linearizes multiplicative relationships. The resulting geometric structure unifies diverse mathematical domains.",
