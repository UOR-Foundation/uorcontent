  "sourceText": "Observer-Dependent Time is a key concept where different observers experience different realizations of the time operator. The time operator connects directly to observer reference frames, ensuring that temporal evolution remains coherent across different observer perspectives.\n\nFor observers O₁ and O₂, with corresponding reference frames R₁ and R₂, the relationship between their time operators can be expressed as: T^(O₁)_Δt = F_{R₁→R₂} ∘ T^(O₂)_Δt' ∘ F_{R₂→R₁}, where F_{Ri→Rj} is the reference frame transformation from Ri to Rj, and Δt' is the time interval as measured in reference frame R₂.\n\nThis formulation generalizes relativistic time dilation and accounts for potentially more complex relationships between observer-dependent time experiences. It ensures that while different observers may experience time differently, the underlying coherence of objects is preserved across these different perspectives."
