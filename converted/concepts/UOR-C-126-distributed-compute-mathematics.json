  "text": "The mathematical foundation of Distributed Compute revolves around the formalization of distributed computation as coherence-preserving transformations in the prime coordinate space. This enables computational tasks to be distributed across network nodes while maintaining global coherence properties.\n\nFor a block B requiring conversion from representation R₁ to R₂, the distributed computation is defined as: C_{R₁→R₂}(B) = ⊕_{i=1}^n C_i(B_i), where B is partitioned into {B₁, B₂, ..., Bₙ}, each C_i is a local conversion operation on node i, and ⊕ is a coherence-preserving aggregation operation.\n\nThe system ensures that: d_C(B, C_{R₁→R₂}(B)) < ε, where d_C is a coherence distance metric and ε is a maximum allowed distortion. This provides a mathematical guarantee that the distributed transformation preserves the essential information properties of the original data.\n\nFor dynamic resource allocation, the system optimizes: min ∑_{i=1}^n r_i subject to C(⊕_{i=1}^n C_i(B_i)) > τ, where r_i represents the resources allocated to node i and τ is the minimum required coherence threshold. This optimization problem ensures that computational resources are allocated efficiently while maintaining the required coherence properties.",
