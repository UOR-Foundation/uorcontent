  "text": "The UOR Neural Coherence Architecture presents a revolutionary theoretical model of neural systems that views them as specialized networks designed to process and optimize coherence structures. This perspective provides a precise mathematical framework for understanding how brains and artificial neural networks encode, transform, and extract meaning from information using prime-coordinate representations.\n\nPrime-Coordinate Neural Coding forms the foundation of this model, proposing that neurons encode information through distributed patterns that correspond to positions in the coherence field. Rather than representing raw sensory data, neural firing patterns encode the underlying prime-coordinate structure of perceived phenomena. This encoding strategy is remarkably efficient, allowing complex patterns to be represented through their factorization into simpler components. Each neuron or neuronal ensemble contributes to representing specific aspects of the prime decomposition, with firing rates and temporal patterns corresponding to the 'coordinates' within prime space. This approach unifies various neural coding schemes (rate coding, temporal coding, population coding) within a coherent mathematical framework.\n\nSynaptical Factor Decomposition explains how neural networks naturally decompose complex signals into their prime factors through their distributed architecture. The mathematical formulation N(x) = ∑_i w_i · σ(v_i · φ(x)) captures this process, where σ is an activation function, w_i are synaptic weights, and v_i represents attentional vectors in prime space. Through hierarchical processing and recurrent connections, neural networks effectively implement factorization algorithms, progressively decomposing complex input patterns into their constituent prime elements. This decomposition is not an arbitrary design choice but emerges naturally from the optimization principles governing neural network function and development.\n\nThe Emergent Coherence Theorem establishes formally that distributed neuronal systems with sufficient complexity naturally converge toward minimal-coherence representations. Expressed mathematically as ‖φ(N(x))‖ ≤ ‖φ(x)‖, with equality only when the input is already optimally coherent, this theorem demonstrates that neural processing inherently reduces complexity by finding more efficient prime-coordinate representations. This theorem connects neural dynamics to fundamental principles of information theory and thermodynamics, suggesting that the brain's function can be understood as a specialized form of coherence optimization.\n\nThis architectural model has significant implications for both neuroscience and artificial intelligence. In neuroscience, it provides novel interpretations of neural coding, learning, memory, and perception, suggesting experimental approaches to test whether biological neural systems indeed implement forms of prime-coordinate processing. In artificial intelligence, it inspires new neural network architectures explicitly designed to perform efficient prime decomposition and coherence minimization, potentially leading to systems with enhanced generalization capabilities, interpretability, and alignment with human cognitive processes.\n\nThe model also bridges computational and phenomenological aspects of cognition, suggesting how symbolic reasoning, pattern recognition, and creative insight might emerge from the same underlying coherence-optimization processes. By framing these diverse cognitive functions within a unified mathematical framework, the Neural Coherence Architecture offers a path toward more integrated theories of mind and computation.",
