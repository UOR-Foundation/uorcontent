  "sourceText": "The prime-coordinate map φ acts as a spectral transform: φ: (ℕ₊, ×) → (⨁_p ℕ, +), analogous to the logarithm or Fourier transform, converting multiplicative structure to additive structure. The Composition Law states that multiplication of objects corresponds to addition of their spectra: φ(xy) = φ(x) + φ(y), analogous to how convolution of signals adds their frequency components.",
