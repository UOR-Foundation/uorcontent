  "sourceText": "The prime-coordinate space inherits a natural Euclidean structure from the coherence norm and inner product. The coherence norm ||φ(x)|| measures the intrinsic complexity of an object. The inner product ⟨φ(x),φ(y)⟩ quantifies the degree of prime-factor similarity. Angles between coordinate vectors represent compositional relationships. Orthogonal objects have no common prime factors.",
