  "sourceText": "Theorem 1 (Universal Representation): Every universal number Œ∑ ‚àà ùïå admits a canonical representation as a triple:\n\nŒ∑ = (z, (a‚Çö)‚Çö‚àà‚Ñô, œÜ(Œ∑))\n\nwhere:\n- z ‚àà ‚ÑÇ is its complex value\n- a‚Çö ‚àà ‚Ñ§‚Çö is its p-adic expansion for each prime p\n- œÜ(Œ∑) is its prime coordinate vector\n\nThese representations satisfy rigorous compatibility conditions ensuring consistency across all embedded domains.\n\nUniversal numbers exhibit crucial meta-theoretical properties that establish their coherence within the UOR framework:\n\n1. Category-Theoretic Universality: ùïå represents the universal completion of ‚Ñö with respect to all possible completions, making it the terminal object in an appropriate category of number systems.\n\n2. Model-Theoretic Completeness: The theory of universal numbers is model-complete when formalized in an appropriate multi-sorted logic accommodating both Archimedean and non-Archimedean aspects.\n\n3. Information-Theoretic Optimality: The universal coordinate representation achieves minimal descriptive complexity for representing numbers across multiple domains.\n\n4. Intrinsic Coordinate Invariance: The coordinate representation is invariant under automorphisms of the number system, reflecting intrinsic structural properties rather than arbitrary conventions."
