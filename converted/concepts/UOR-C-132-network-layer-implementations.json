  "text": "The UOR-Network mapping provides practical protocol implementations across all layers of the networking stack, translating abstract UOR principles into concrete networking mechanisms.\n\nThe Physical Layer Mapping (Layer 1) maps UOR principles to physical signal transmission, establishing how abstract mathematical representations are translated into physical signals. This is formalized as Signal(φ(I)) = Modulate(Encode(φ(I))), where Signal is the physical representation of information, Modulate is the modulation function, and Encode is the encoding function that preserves prime structure. Key implementations include Coherence-Preserving Modulation schemes that minimize coherence loss during signal transmission, Prime-Structured Error Correction codes that leverage prime factorization properties for robust error detection and correction, and Quantum-Aware Transmission protocols that account for quantum effects in signal propagation.\n\nThe Data Link Layer Mapping (Layer 2) implements frame structures based on prime coordinate representations, defining how abstract mathematical representations are organized into data link frames. This is formalized as Frame(φ(I)) = [Header(φ(I)) | Payload(φ(I)) | Footer(φ(I))], where Frame is the data link frame, and Header, Payload, and Footer are derived from different projections of the prime coordinates. Key implementations include Self-Describing Frames that encode their own optimal processing attributes, Coherence-Preserving Aggregation mechanisms for frame bundling that maintains information coherence, and Adaptive Frame Sizes that automatically adjust to coherence requirements.\n\nThe Network Layer Mapping (Layer 3) implements routing and addressing based on UOR principles, establishing how abstract mathematical representations guide packet routing decisions. This is formalized as Route(S, D) = argmin_paths ∑_{i=1}^{n-1} ||φ(N_i) - φ(N_{i+1})||_c, where Route is the optimal path from source S to destination D, N_i are the nodes along the path, and ||·||_c is the coherence norm. Key implementations include Coherence-Based Routing algorithms that optimize for coherence preservation, Prime Coordinate Addressing schemes derived from prime coordinates, and Gravitational Flow Control mechanisms based on information mass and gravity models.\n\nThe Transport Layer Mapping (Layer 4) ensures coherent end-to-end information delivery, defining how abstract mathematical representations are preserved during transmission. This is formalized as Deliver(φ(I), S, D) = ReconstituteD(TransportS→D(DecomposeS(φ(I)))), where Deliver is the end-to-end delivery function, DecomposeS breaks information into transportable units at the source, TransportS→D moves these units from source to destination, and ReconstituteD reassembles the original information at the destination. Key implementations include Coherence-Preserving Segmentation for packet segmentation that maintains prime structure, Self-Healing Flows that automatically repair coherence violations, and Quantum-Entangled Delivery protocols leveraging quantum-like correlations.\n\nThe Application Layer Mapping (Layers 5-7) implements high-level UOR concepts, translating abstract mathematical representations into application-level functionality. This is formalized as App(φ(I)) = Interpret(Process(Present(φ(I)))), where App is the application-level representation, Present formats information for processing, Process performs application-specific transformations, and Interpret derives meaning from the processed information. Key implementations include Self-Defining Media Types that specify their own optimal handling, Coherence-Aware APIs that preserve information coherence, and Observer-Invariant Interactions that maintain consistency across reference frames.",
