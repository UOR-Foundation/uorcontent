  "sourceText": "By leveraging these pivot fields, transformations can maintain essential information structure even when moving between dramatically different representational domains.\n\nKey Insights:\n- **Cross-Domain Bridging:** Pivot fields bridge different representational domains through their prime coordinate structure.\n- **Coherence Preservation:** The mapping preserves coherence relationships across transformations.\n- **Invariant Structure:** Certain structural invariants are maintained regardless of the specific representation."
