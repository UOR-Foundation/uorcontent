  "sourceText": "The theory of universal analysis satisfies coherence axioms that align with UOR principles:\n\nAxiom A1 (Analytical Extension): Every complex analytic function with p-adic analytic counterparts extends uniquely to a universal analytic function.\n\nAxiom A2 (Coordinate Analyticity): The prime-coordinate transformation φ preserves analyticity, mapping universal analytic functions to analytic operations on coordinate space.\n\nAxiom A3 (Computational Effectiveness): Every universal analytic function admits effective algorithms for evaluation, differentiation, and integration to arbitrary precision.\n\nAxiom A4 (Observer Invariance): Analytical properties of universal functions remain invariant under changes of observer reference frame, whether complex-analytic or p-adic.\n\nThese axioms ensure that universal analysis forms a coherent extension of classical analysis aligned with the UOR framework.\n\nThrough universal analysis, the rich traditions of complex analysis and p-adic analysis unite in a coherent framework, enabling analytical methods that work consistently across different number domains while maintaining full alignment with the UOR prime-coordinate principles."
