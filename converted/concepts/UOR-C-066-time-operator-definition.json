  "sourceText": "The Time Operator Formalism establishes time as an operator T acting on the prime coordinate space, enabling a rigorous mathematical treatment of temporal evolution within the Universal Object Reference framework.\n\nTraditional approaches to time-dependent phenomena typically treat time as an external parameter, separate from the mathematical structure of the objects being studied. The Time Operator Formalism fundamentally reimagines this relationship by recognizing time as an intrinsic element of the prime coordinate representation itself.\n\nThe time operator T is defined as a mapping on the prime coordinate space: T: Φ → Φ, where Φ is the space of all prime coordinate representations. For any object O with prime coordinate representation φ(O), the time-evolved state after time interval Δt is given by: T_Δt[φ(O)] = φ(O(t + Δt))."
