  "sourceText": "Signal compression in the UOR framework operates on fundamentally different principles than traditional compression techniques. Rather than exploiting statistical redundancy or perceptual limitations, UOR compression optimizes the prime coordinate representation to create compact digests that preserve the essential information structure.\n\nFor a signal `S` with prime coordinate representation `φ(S)`, define a compression operator `K` that produces a compact digest representation: `K(φ(S)) = φ'(S)`\n\nWhere `φ'(S)` is a reduced prime coordinate representation that satisfies: `d(φ(S), φ'(S)) < ε`\n\nHere, `d` is a coherence-preserving distance metric and `ε` is the maximum allowed deviation in essential structure.\n\nThe compression ratio `r` is given by: `r = |φ'(S)| / |φ(S)|`\n\nWhere `|·|` measures the representational complexity."
