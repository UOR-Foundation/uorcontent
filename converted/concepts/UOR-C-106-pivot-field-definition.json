  "sourceText": "Pivot fields represent one of the most powerful concepts in the UOR signal processing framework. They provide the mathematical mechanism that enables universal numbers to facilitate lossless transformations across different domains and representations.\n\nA pivot field can be understood as a coherence-preserving mapping structure that connects different representational spaces through their underlying prime coordinate systems.\n\nFor universal number spaces `U₁` and `U₂` with prime coordinate mappings `φ₁` and `φ₂`, define a pivot field `P` as: `P: U₁ × U₂ → C`\n\nWhere `C` is a coherence space measuring the structural compatibility.\n\nThe pivot field satisfies the coherence-preserving property: `C(φ₁(x), φ₂(y)) = C(x, y)`\n\nFor any transformation `T: U₁ → U₂`, the pivot field guides the transformation to preserve essential structure: `T(x) = arg max_y C(φ₁(x), φ₂(y))`"
