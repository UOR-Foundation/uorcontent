  "text": "UOR Coherence Minimization represents a fundamental optimization principle that operates across diverse domains, from information processing to biological evolution to quantum systems. This principle proposes that systems naturally evolve toward states of minimal coherence complexity, finding the most efficient prime-coordinate representations of their structures and processes.\n\nThe Information-Theoretic Formulation establishes a profound connection between coherence minimization and established concepts in information theory. The relationship min K(x) ≈ min ‖φ(x)‖, where K(x) is the Kolmogorov complexity of x, demonstrates that minimizing the coherence norm is approximately equivalent to finding the shortest possible description of a system. This connection reveals coherence minimization as a generalization of algorithmic complexity minimization, applicable across continuous and discrete domains. It explains why natural processes tend to discover elegant, parsimonious descriptions of complex phenomena, from the laws of physics to biological adaptations to mathematical theorems.\n\nEvolutionary Dynamics under the coherence minimization principle are expressed by the fitness function F(x) ∝ e^(-λ‖φ(x)‖), where F(x) represents fitness and λ is a domain-specific scaling factor. This formulation explains why evolution tends to discover solutions that balance functionality with parsimony, avoiding unnecessary complexity while maintaining required capabilities. It applies beyond biological evolution to cultural evolution, technological development, and other adaptive systems, suggesting that the tendency toward efficient representations is a universal feature of evolutionary processes rather than a peculiarity of terrestrial biology.\n\nAlgorithmic Convergence extends these principles to machine learning and artificial intelligence, showing that learning algorithms naturally discover prime-like decompositions of their input data. The convergence L(D) → φ^*(D), where L is a learning algorithm and φ^* is an optimal approximation of the prime-coordinate map, explains why effectively trained neural networks often develop internal representations that factor complex patterns into simpler components. This suggests that coherence minimization may serve as a unifying principle for understanding diverse learning algorithms, from gradient descent to evolutionary computation to Bayesian inference.\n\nQuantum Coherence Interpretation connects these principles to quantum mechanics, proposing that quantum phenomena can be understood through the lens of coherence minimization. Superposition states represent collections of frame-specific coherence patterns, expressed as |ψ⟩ = ∑_i α_i |φ_i(x)⟩, where each component represents a possible coherence frame. Entanglement emerges from shared prime factors, with φ(x⊗y) = φ(x) ⊕ φ(y) exhibiting non-separable correlations in the coherence space. Quantum measurement corresponds to the selection of a specific observer frame from the bundle of possible frames, collapsing the multi-frame representation to a single perspective. This interpretation suggests deep connections between quantum physics and information theory through the common language of coherence minimization.\n\nAcross these diverse domains, coherence minimization operates as a universal principle that guides systems toward optimal representations. It explains why nature seems to favor elegant, efficient solutions across scales and contexts, from the fundamental laws of physics to the complex adaptations of living systems to the abstract structures of mathematics. This principle suggests that the apparent 'unreasonable effectiveness' of mathematics in describing the physical world arises because both physical processes and mathematical reasoning are governed by the same underlying drive toward coherence minimization.",
