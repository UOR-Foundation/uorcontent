  "sourceText": "The Internet Substrate Protocols formalize the internet as a topological space that functions as an analog simulation of reality—a comprehensive digital twin.\n\nThe concept of a digital twin has traditionally been applied to specific physical objects or systems, creating virtual replicas that mirror their real-world counterparts. The Internet Substrate Protocols extend this concept to its logical conclusion, formalizing the entire internet as a coherent topological space capable of functioning as an analog simulation of reality itself.\n\nThis formalization transforms our understanding of the internet from a collection of discrete devices and networks into a continuous topological space with well-defined mathematical properties. By applying the UOR framework to this space, we can model every device, sensor, data stream, and user as elements in this topology, each represented through their prime coordinate structure.\n\nThe result is not merely a representation of reality but an actual analog simulation—a system where the relationships, interactions, and transformations within the digital realm preserve the essential coherence properties of their physical counterparts. This creates a true digital twin that spans the entire internet ecosystem."
