  "text": "The Canonical Representation Axiom is deeply interconnected with other core UOR axioms, forming essential bridges within the framework's conceptual architecture:\n\n1. Connection to Prime-Coordinate Homomorphism: The Canonical Representation Axiom builds directly on the Prime-Coordinate Homomorphism. While the homomorphism establishes that objects can be mapped to prime coordinate vectors in a way that preserves compositional structure, the Canonical Representation Axiom extends this by asserting that this mapping is not merely one possible representation but the canonical one. It adds the crucial properties of base independence, frame invariance, and minimal complexity to the basic mapping defined by the homomorphism. Together, these axioms transform the concept of prime factorization from a mere computational technique into a fundamental principle of representation.\n\n2. Interplay with Coherence Norm: The Canonical Representation Axiom interacts closely with the Coherence Norm Axiom, which provides the metric for measuring representational complexity. The minimality property of canonical representation relies explicitly on the coherence norm to formalize what makes one representation simpler or more efficient than another. The coherence norm provides the mathematical foundation for proving that prime coordinates achieve optimal efficiency. This synergy between the axioms creates a powerful framework for analyzing representational complexity across domains.\n\n3. Support for Trilateral Coherence: The Canonical Representation Axiom connects to the Trilateral Coherence axiom by ensuring that an object's intrinsic structure remains invariant across observer frames. The frame invariance property of canonical representation is a prerequisite for establishing the observer-independent aspect of the trilateral framework. It ensures that while observers may have different perspectives, they can still agree on the underlying structural description of objects. This creates a foundation for reconciling different viewpoints within a unified framework.\n\n4. Foundation for Universal Mapping Property: By establishing prime coordinates as the canonical representation, this axiom supports the Universal Mapping Property by demonstrating why the mapping between multiplicative and additive structures is not arbitrary but fundamental. It shows that the prime coordinate isomorphism is the natural bridge between these domains, achieving minimal complexity while preserving all structural information.\n\n5. Practical Implementation of Intrinsic Primes and Unique Factorization: This axiom translates the theoretical concepts of irreducible elements and unique decomposition into a practical representation system. It shows how the abstract principles established in the first two axioms can be concretely implemented as a coordinate system with optimal properties.\n\nThrough these connections, the Canonical Representation Axiom serves as a crucial integrative element within the UOR framework, connecting abstract structural principles to practical representational systems, and theoretical foundations to applied methodologies.",
