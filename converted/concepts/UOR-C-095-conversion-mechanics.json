Prime Decomposition: Convert the original block to its prime coordinate representation, extracting the essential structural information from the raw binary data.\n\n2. Coordinate Transformation: Apply the appropriate transformation to adapt the representation to the target bit-width, preserving the relative relationships between prime coordinates.\n\n3. Coherence Optimization: Ensure that the coherence structure is preserved during the transformation, maintaining the essential information content.\n\n4. Constraint Satisfaction: Adapt the representation to satisfy any constraints imposed by the target format while minimizing coherence distortion.\n\n5. Representation Synthesis: Generate the new block in the target bit-width format, encoding the preserved prime coordinate structure in the appropriate representation.\n\n6. Verification: Validate that the essential properties of the original data are preserved in the converted representation through coherence metrics."
