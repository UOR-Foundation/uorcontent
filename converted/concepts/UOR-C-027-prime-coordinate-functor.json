  "sourceText": "The prime-coordinate map can be understood as a fundamental functor between categories:\n- Base Categories: Define Obj as the category of objects with composition and Mod as the category of graded modules.\n- The Prime Functor: The map φ: Obj → Mod is a functor satisfying: φ(X ⊗ Y) = φ(X) ⊕ φ(Y) and φ(1_Obj) = 0_Mod, where ⊗ is composition in Obj and ⊕ is addition in Mod.\n- Natural Transformation: The homomorphism property of φ manifests as a natural transformation η: ⊗ ⟹ φ^*⊕ between the composition functor and the pulled-back addition functor.\n- Contravariant Properties: For inverse operations, φ exhibits contravariance: φ(X^{-1}) = -φ(X), ensuring compatibility with the group structure in both domains."
