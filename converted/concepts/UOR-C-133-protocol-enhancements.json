  "text": "The UOR-Network mapping provides concrete protocol enhancements and implementation examples that demonstrate the practical benefits of applying UOR principles to networking protocols.\n\nUOR-Enhanced DNS extends traditional Domain Name System functionality with prime coordinate mappings. This is formalized as ResolveUOR(name) = (IPv6(name), φ(name)), where ResolveUOR returns both conventional and UOR-based addressing, IPv6 is the traditional IP mapping, and φ(name) is the prime coordinate representation. This enhancement enables coherent identification across the network while maintaining compatibility with existing systems, providing richer addressing semantics and improved resilience against addressing conflicts.\n\nCoherence-Preserving TCP extends traditional Transmission Control Protocol with coherence guarantees. This is formalized as DeliverCPTCP(φ(I), S, D) = (data, c_value), where DeliverCPTCP returns both the data and its coherence measure, data is the traditional payload, and c_value is the coherence verification value. This enhancement allows applications to verify that the received information maintains its essential structure, enabling new classes of reliability guarantees beyond simple bit-level integrity.\n\nPrime-Structured Routing optimizes network paths based on coherence preservation rather than traditional metrics like hop count or link costs. This is formalized as RoutePS(S, D) = argmin_paths ∑C_loss(path), where RoutePS is the prime-structured routing function and C_loss measures coherence loss along a path. This enhancement creates naturally optimal paths that minimize information distortion across the network, improving both efficiency and fidelity of information transfer.\n\nThese enhancements are supported by provable mathematical theorems. Theorem 1 (Coherence Preservation) states that for any information entity I transmitted through a UOR-compliant protocol stack, the coherence loss is bounded by ||φ(I_source) - φ(I_destination)||_c < ε_max. Theorem 2 (Optimality) establishes that UOR-based routing converges to information-theoretically optimal paths under constraints of coherence preservation. Theorem 3 (Robustness) proves that UOR-compliant protocols exhibit fault tolerance proportional to the prime structural redundancy of the information they carry.\n\nThese mathematical properties translate directly into practical benefits including improved reliability, efficiency, and security across the network. By formalizing the relationship between theoretical UOR properties and network behavior, these enhancements provide a rigorous foundation for next-generation internet protocols that goes beyond the ad hoc designs of conventional networking.",
