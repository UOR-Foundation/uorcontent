  "sourceText": "UOR addresses a fundamental challenge in mathematics and physics: how to provide a canonical, observer-invariant representation for objects across diverse domains. Traditional representation systems face several limitations including observer-dependence leading to ambiguous descriptions. The UOR framework offers invariance as a significant advantage, providing representation independent of arbitrary encoding choices.",
