  "sourceText": "The Universal Object Reference (UOR) framework addresses a fundamental challenge in mathematics and physics: how to provide a canonical, observer-invariant representation for objects across diverse domains. UOR overcomes the limitations of traditional representation systems by providing a universal coordinate system based on prime decomposition. The central insight of UOR is that prime factorization provides a natural, intrinsic coordinate system for objects. The UOR framework offers several significant advantages: universality, invariance, coherence, and integration. The complete UOR framework integrates several components: foundations in unique factorization domains, the prime-coordinate mapping system, coherence metrics, observer reference frames, and geometric and algebraic structures on prime-coordinate spaces.",
