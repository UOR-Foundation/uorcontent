  "text": "The UOR framework extends naturally beyond its core axioms through the UOR Generality Theorem, which states that for any algebraic domain satisfying the UFD axioms (or a GCD domain with finite factorization), the prime-coordinate map φ extends naturally to its field of fractions, polynomial extensions, combinatorial monoids, and localization sheaves, preserving injectivity and coherence geometry.\n\nThis universality enables applications across disciplines: from classical number theory and primality tests to modern cryptographic hardness assumptions, from factorization-based data structures to physical analogues of coherence fields and beyond.\n\nKey extensions and applications include: Beyond Integers, extending to rationals, polynomials, and abstract UFDs; Physics Interpretation, mapping gravity, mass, and energy to coherence geometry; Philosophical Implications, exploring coherence as a universal symmetry of mind and reality; Formal Supplement, providing rigorous topological, categorical, and homological generalizations; Ensuring Unique Factorization, establishing criteria and proofs for unique factorization in new domains; Recent Extensions, presenting case studies in algebraic number theory and quantum systems; Hidden Symphony & Practical Transcendence, exploring the universal language of coherence enabling AI, medicine, and social science; and Ultimate Implication & Incompleteness, examining the vision of reality as coherent information and inherent logical limits.\n\nThese extensions demonstrate how the core UOR principles can be applied and generalized across mathematics, physics, computer science, philosophy, and other disciplines, revealing the framework's power and versatility as a unifying conceptual system.",
