  "text": "The Eight Core UOR Axioms codify the essential properties ensuring that any Unique Factorization Domain (UFD) supports a fully coherent, observer‐aware, prime‐coordinate representation. These axioms act as the logical scaffolding underpinning the entire Prime Framework.\n\nThe eight core axioms are: Intrinsic Primes, where a set of atomic elements exists such that no element factors further under composition; Unique Factorization, where every non-unit object admits a finite prime decomposition that is unique up to reordering; Prime-Coordinate Homomorphism, where an injective map φ transforms objects into vectors of prime exponents, converting multiplication to addition; Canonical Representation, where the prime coordinates φ(X) provide a unique, base-independent, frame-invariant encoding that minimizes complexity; Coherence Norm, where a metric on coordinate space proves that prime factorization achieves minimal representational complexity; Coherence Inner Product, where the prime coordinate space forms a Euclidean geometry with orthonormal prime axes; Trilateral Coherence, where every valid description integrates structure (primes), dynamics (transformations), and observer perspective; and Universal Mapping Property, where the prime coordinate map is the canonical bridge between multiplicative structures and additive ones.\n\nThese axioms establish a universal coordinate system for arbitrary objects based on their intrinsic structure. By ensuring that objects can be uniquely decomposed and encoded, the framework enables a coherent reference system that remains invariant across observer frames while capturing all essential structural information.\n\nThe power of this axiomatic foundation lies in its ability to unify diverse mathematical domains under a single coherent framework, providing a common language for representing and analyzing structure across disciplines.",
