  "text": "The Universal Coordinates framework achieves its full power through deep integration with the Universal Object Reference (UOR) principles. This section explains how universal numbers realize core UOR axioms and enable transformative applications across signal processing and other domains.\n\nThe universal number system ùïå instantiates the UOR prime-coordinate axioms: Intrinsic Primes, where prime numbers serve as the atomic, irreducible elements of the system; Unique Factorization, where every universal number admits a unique representation in terms of prime components; Prime-Coordinate Homomorphism, where the mapping œÜ: ùïå ‚Üí ‚ÑÇ^‚àû transforms multiplication to coordinate addition; Canonical Representation, providing a minimal, observer-invariant encoding; Coherence Metrics, where the universal metric induces norms that measure representational complexity; Inner Product Structure, supporting inner products aligning with coherence principles; and Trilateral Coherence, where structure, dynamics, and observer frames integrate coherently.\n\nUniversal numbers embody the dimensional structure envisioned in UOR, with the set of prime numbers forming a complete basis for the universal number space. Each prime constitutes an independent dimension in the coordinate space, the full space of universal numbers is spanned by the prime dimensions, coordinate values quantify extent along each prime dimension, and operations in the universal number space have natural coordinate interpretations.\n\nUniversal numbers establish a rigorous foundation for the signal processing principles of UOR. They enable transformations between signal domains through universal coordinate representation, cross-domain transformation, information preservation, and dimensional transcendence. Universal numbers provide the computational mechanism for Block Conversion, through coordinate analysis, structure-preserving transformation, domain synthesis, and complexity control.\n\nUniversal numbers enable precise quantification of information coherence, including signal complexity, structural similarity, information preservation, and observer independence. These measures provide rigorous metrics for the information coherence principles of UOR.\n\nThe universal number framework maps explicitly to UOR categories: structure aspects map to prime numbers as basis dimensions, unique factorization, and coordinate measures; dynamics aspects map to functions on prime-coordinate space, algebraic operations, and metric transitions; and observer aspects map to choices of metrics and valuations, computations on coordinate representations, and consistency checks.\n\nUniversal numbers provide a practical translation layer between theoretical UOR principles and concrete applications, through mathematical accessibility, computational realizability, cross-domain coherence, and incremental adoption. The five axioms of the universal number system are precise specializations of the UOR axioms, establishing a perfect consistency between the frameworks.\n\nUniversal numbers enable transformative applications in signal processing, including cross-domain filtering, dimensional compression, and information-preserving scaling. Beyond practical applications, universal numbers reveal meta-mathematical insights about the UOR framework, validating its philosophical foundations while establishing its compatibility with rigorous mathematics.",
