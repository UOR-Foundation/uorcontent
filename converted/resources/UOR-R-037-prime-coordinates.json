  "text": "Prime coordinates provide a powerful mapping system that transforms objects into vectors in an exponent space, revealing their intrinsic structure.\n\nFor any object x in a domain with unique factorization, the prime-coordinate map φ assigns to x its vector of prime exponents: φ(x) maps each prime p to its exponent in the factorization of x; the result is a vector in the exponent space (typically Z^P for finite products); and this mapping is a homomorphism where φ(x·y) = φ(x) + φ(y).\n\nThe prime-coordinate representation has several remarkable properties: Injectivity, where distinct objects map to distinct coordinate vectors; Linearization, where multiplication becomes vector addition in coordinate space; Dimension reduction, where infinite objects are represented by finite vectors; and Base independence, where representation is intrinsic, not tied to numeral systems.\n\nViewing prime coordinates geometrically reveals deep structure: Each prime corresponds to an orthogonal dimension; Objects become points in a discrete lattice; Divisibility relations become geometric containment; and Prime powers trace rays along coordinate axes.\n\nThis coordinate system transforms the multiplicative structure into an additive vector space, making complex patterns of factorization visually and algebraically accessible.",
