  "text": "A fundamental principle of UOR is that every object has a unique, canonical representation that is independent of basis, numeral system, or observer frame.\n\nUnlike conventional number representations (binary, decimal, etc.), the prime-coordinate representation is intrinsic to the object itself:\n\n- Not tied to any particular numeral base\n- Independent of arbitrary encoding choices\n- Reveals the object's inherent structure rather than human-imposed format\n\nThe canonical representation satisfies several crucial properties:\n\n- Uniqueness: Each object maps to exactly one prime-coordinate representation\n- Completeness: All properties of the object can be recovered from its representation\n- Invariance: The representation remains unchanged under permissible transformations\n\nAmong all possible representations of an object, the canonical prime-coordinate form:\n\n- Minimizes the coherence norm\n- Provides the most efficient encoding (minimum description length)\n- Contains no redundant information\n\nWhile observer reference frames may interpret the representation differently, the underlying prime structure remains objective:\n\n- Different frames observe the same intrinsic prime decomposition\n- Frame transformations preserve the canonical structure\n- All valid observers agree on the factorization, even with different perspectives\n\nThis canonical representation forms the foundation for UOR's ability to provide unambiguous reference across disparate domains and observer perspectives.",
