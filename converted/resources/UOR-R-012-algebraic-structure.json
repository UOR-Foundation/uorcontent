  "text": "The universal number system 𝕌 possesses a rich and rigorous algebraic structure that unifies properties from classical number systems while maintaining prime-coordinate coherence in accordance with UOR axioms.\n\nUniversal numbers form a field with precisely defined operations that extend the fundamental operations on prime-coordinates. For universal numbers α, β ∈ 𝕌 with prime-coordinate representations φ(α) = (a₁, a₂, ...) and φ(β) = (b₁, b₂, ...):\n\n1. Addition: φ(α + β) = log(exp(φ(α)) + exp(φ(β)))\n   Where exp and log operate componentwise on the prime-coordinate vectors\n\n2. Multiplication: φ(α · β) = φ(α) + φ(β)\n   Direct vector addition in the prime-coordinate space\n\n3. Additive Inverse: φ(-α) = log(exp(0) - exp(φ(α)))\n   Where 0 represents the zero vector in coordinate space\n\n4. Multiplicative Inverse: φ(α⁻¹) = -φ(α)\n   Negation of each coordinate in the prime-coordinate representation\n\nAll algebraic operations on universal numbers derive from the prime-coordinate framework through the principle of \"operational lifting\", which states that any algebraic operation on universal numbers can be expressed as a corresponding operation on their prime-coordinate representations through the homomorphism φ.\n\nThe universal number system achieves algebraic completeness while maintaining computability. The field 𝕌 is computably algebraically closed, meaning every non-constant polynomial P(x) ∈ 𝕌[x] has exactly as many roots (counting multiplicity) in 𝕌 as its degree, and these roots are effectively computable through prime-coordinate algorithms.\n\nThe universal number system forms the apex of a coherent hierarchy of number fields, where 𝕌ₐ represents the algebraic universal numbers (those with algebraic coordinates), and the universal numbers 𝕌 extend and unify all classical number systems.\n\nUniversal numbers exhibit a rich Galois-theoretic structure that extends classical Galois theory to the prime-coordinate framework, with a canonical Galois correspondence between subfields of 𝕌 closed under specific classes of operations and subgroups of the automorphism group Aut(𝕌) that preserve prime-coordinate structure.\n\nUniversal numbers support a coherent system of valuations derived from their prime-coordinate structure, including prime-indexed valuations and an Archimedean meta-valuation. These valuations satisfy a generalized product formula that extends the classical formula of algebraic number theory.\n\nThe universal number system contains both algebraic and transcendental elements with precisely characterized properties, stratifying into algebraic universal numbers, coordinate-transcendental numbers, and fully transcendental numbers.\n\nThe automorphism group of 𝕌 reveals deep symmetries in the universal number structure, generated by prime-permuting automorphisms, coordinate-scaling automorphisms, and conjugation automorphisms.\n\nA mathematical object belongs to 𝕌 if and only if it admits a unique prime-coordinate representation with complex exponents, the coordinate vector satisfies specific compatibility conditions, and the resulting structure is compatible with both complex and p-adic metrics.\n\nThe algebraic structure of universal numbers enables powerful computational results, including an effective algorithm for determining whether polynomials have common roots and computing such roots if they exist, and the ability to lift computational problems in algebraic number theory to the universal domain 𝕌 and solve them through prime-coordinate algorithms.",
