  "text": "The Prime Formula provides a formal mathematical definition of the prime decomposition and valuation process in a Unique Factorization Domain.\n\nFor any non-zero non-unit element x in a Unique Factorization Domain D, the canonical prime factorization is given by: x = u · p₁^e₁ · p₂^e₂ · ... · pₙ^eₙ, where: u is a unit in D; Each pᵢ is a distinct prime in D; eᵢ is the exponent (valuation) of prime pᵢ; and the product is finite (only finitely many primes have non-zero exponents).\n\nThe prime valuation function v_p(x) returns the highest power of prime p that divides x. For example, v_2(12) = 2 because 2² divides 12, but 2³ does not. This function has several important properties: v_p(xy) = v_p(x) + v_p(y) for all x, y; v_p(x+y) ≥ min(v_p(x), v_p(y)) with equality when v_p(x) ≠ v_p(y); v_p(1) = 0 for all primes p; and v_p(p) = 1 for prime p.\n\nThe valuation function extends to define the prime-coordinate map φ: φ(x) = (v_p(x))_p. This maps each element to its vector of prime exponents, forming the mathematical basis for the UOR framework's representation system.",
