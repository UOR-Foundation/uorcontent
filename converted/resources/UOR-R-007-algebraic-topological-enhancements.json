  "text": "The UOR framework can be enhanced with advanced mathematical structures that reveal deeper patterns and relationships in prime-coordinate space.\n\nBy extending the coherence inner product to a full Clifford algebra structure, we gain access to powerful geometric tools:\n\n- Multivector representations allow composite objects to be described using exterior products of prime basis elements\n- Prime-coordinate transformations become operations in the Clifford algebra\n- The geometric product combines inner products and exterior products into a unified algebraic structure\n\nThe prime-coordinate mapping naturally gives rise to sheaf structures:\n\n- Local-to-global principles allow coherence properties that hold locally to extend to global structures\n- The spectral sheaf associates to each open set in prime-coordinate space the algebraic spectrum of corresponding elements\n- Cohomological invariants measure obstructions to extending local prime-coordinate representations\n\nObserver reference frames in UOR can be generalized to include quantum-like properties:\n\n- Superposition of frames allows multiple observer perspectives to be combined coherently\n- Reference frame entanglement creates correlations between different observer frames\n- Measurement-like collapse occurs when selecting a specific frame from superpositions, revealing complementary structure properties\n\nThese algebraic and topological enhancements provide a richer mathematical landscape for exploring coherence principles, connecting UOR to advanced areas of mathematics and theoretical physics.",
