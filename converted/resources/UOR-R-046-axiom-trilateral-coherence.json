  "text": "Every valid description of an object incorporates three coherent aspects: its intrinsic prime-coordinate structure, the dynamics (composition rules), and the observer reference frame.\n\nThe Trilateral Coherence axiom establishes that a complete understanding of any object requires the integration of three fundamental aspects: its intrinsic structure (what it is), its dynamics (how it transforms), and the observer's perspective (how it's measured or described). This triad forms an inseparable whole - no aspect can be eliminated without losing essential information.\n\nBy formalizing the observer as a core component of the framework, rather than an external consideration, UOR provides a powerful mechanism for handling reference frames and context in a mathematically rigorous way. This approach ensures that while descriptions may vary with perspective, the underlying intrinsic structure remains invariant - a crucial property for any universal reference system.\n\nKey insights include: Complete Description, where no aspect of the triad can be removed without losing essential information - structure needs dynamics to evolve, dynamics need structure to act upon, and both need an observer to be contextualized; Frame Invariance, where while descriptions may vary with observer perspective, intrinsic properties like prime coordinates remain invariant - the framework distinguishes between observer-dependent and observer-independent aspects; and Fiber Bundle Structure, where the observer perspective is formalized as a fiber bundle, where each object has attached to it the space of all possible reference frames.\n\nThe framework represents an observed object as a tuple (X, D, r) where: X is the object with its intrinsic prime structure φ(X), D is the set of dynamics or transformations applicable to X, and r is an observer frame from the space R of all possible frames. Frame transformations r → r' form a group acting on descriptions, with the constraint that φ(X) remains invariant under all such transformations.\n\nTrilateral Coherence integrates with the Canonical Representation axiom by ensuring that prime coordinates remain invariant across observer frames. It extends the entire framework beyond pure structure (primes and coordinates) to include dynamics and context, establishing UOR as a comprehensive system for describing not just objects, but objects in context and undergoing transformation.",
