  "text": "Recent work has expanded the UOR framework to new domains and applications, demonstrating its versatility across pure and applied mathematics, physics, computer science, and systems theory.\n\nIn the area of Hyperbolic Geometry in Prime Space, the prime coordinate space admits a natural hyperbolic metric when extended to include infinite-dimensional vectors. This extension reveals connections to modular forms and spectral theory of automorphic representations.\n\nIn Quantum Information Theory, prime decompositions provide optimal encoding for quantum information, with coherence measures directly related to von Neumann entropy. Quantum circuits can be analyzed as coherence-preserving maps between prime spectral representations.\n\nFor Machine Learning Architectures, deep neural networks trained with coherence regularization show improved generalization. Attention mechanisms based on prime-coordinate similarity metrics outperform standard dot-product attention on complex reasoning tasks.\n\nCryptographic Applications leverage the fact that factorization hardness underpins many cryptographic systems. UOR's perspective on prime structures has led to novel approaches for post-quantum cryptography based on spectral hardness assumptions.\n\nIn Complex Systems Analysis, emergent phenomena can be characterized by their coherence signatures. Critical transitions correspond to rapid changes in prime spectral distributions, providing early warning signals for system collapse.\n\nThese extensions demonstrate UOR's versatility and continued evolution as researchers discover new connections between prime structures and diverse phenomena across multiple disciplines.",
