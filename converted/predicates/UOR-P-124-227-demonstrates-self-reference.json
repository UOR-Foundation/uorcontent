  "value": "The resource demonstrates how self-reference emerges naturally from the prime encoding structure through the Diagonal Lemma, which asserts that for any formula with one free variable, there exists a sentence that asserts it has the property expressed by that formula. This construction demonstrates a fixed point in prime-coordinate space, where the coordinates of a formula incorporate the coordinates of their own GÃ¶del encoding, enabling the creation of self-referential statements that are crucial for understanding the limitations of formal systems.",
