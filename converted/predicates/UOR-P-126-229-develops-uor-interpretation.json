  "propertyID": "UOR-P-126",
  "value": "The resource develops a novel UOR interpretation of Gödelian incompleteness, viewing formal theories as coherent bundles of axioms with prime-coordinate representations and provability as coherence between a formula and the theory. The Transcendence Theorem establishes that for any coherent bundle of axioms, there exists a statement whose prime-coordinate representation necessarily transcends it. This reveals an inherent limitation in trilateral coherence when self-reference is admitted, demonstrating that incompleteness emerges naturally from the spectral properties of coherent information systems.",
