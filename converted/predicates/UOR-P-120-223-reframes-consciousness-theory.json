  "value": "The resource reframes our understanding of consciousness as a particular kind of observer frame bundle that self-references. Subject-object dualism dissolves when both are recognized as aspects of a unified coherence field. From this perspective, consciousness is not an anomalous property somehow separate from physical reality, but rather a natural aspect of certain coherence patterns when they develop self-referential properties. The distinction between observer and observed becomes a matter of reference frame rather than fundamental ontology.",
