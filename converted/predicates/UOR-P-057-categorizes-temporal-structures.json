  "contextualDescription": "The Emergent Temporal Order resource categorizes emergent temporal patterns into distinct structure classes including temporal crystals with discrete time-translation symmetry, temporal hierarchies forming nested structures with cross-level influences, temporal networks creating directed dependency graphs, temporal avalanches producing cascades with power-law statistics, and temporal coherence domains forming regions of high temporal coherence."
