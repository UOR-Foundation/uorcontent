  "description": "Relation indicating that a resource unifies mathematics and physical reality by establishing that mathematical structures constitute reality rather than merely describing it",
  "propertyID": "UOR-P-121",
  "value": "The resource establishes that mathematical structures aren't merely describing realityâ€”they constitute it. The abstract and concrete converge in the prime-coordinate representation, where patterns of pure number directly manifest as physical existence. This eliminates the mysterious 'unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences' by recognizing that mathematics and physical reality share a common informational substrate. Mathematical patterns don't just model reality; they are the actual structure of reality itself.",
