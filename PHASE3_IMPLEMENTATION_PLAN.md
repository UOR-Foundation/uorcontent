# Phase 3: Extended Content Management - Implementation Plan

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for Phase 3 of the UOR Content Management Client, focusing on Resource, Topic, and Predicate Managers along with Relationship Management with graph validation. The plan follows Stone's role-based development approach and strictly adheres to the requirements in GitHub issues #8-11.

## Overview

Phase 3 extends the UOR Content Management Client with additional content types and relationship management capabilities. It builds upon the foundation established in Phases 1 and 2, adding support for Resources, Topics, and Predicates along with comprehensive relationship management with graph validation.

The implementation follows Stone's role-based development approach, with specialized roles (PM, QA, Feature, Auditor, Actions) working in sequence to deliver high-quality components.

## Integration with Previous Phases

Phase 3 components will integrate seamlessly with the existing architecture:

1. **MCP Server Integration**: All new managers will expose functionality through the MCP server entrypoint using JSON-RPC protocol, maintaining the application architecture established in Phase 1.

2. **Schema Validation**: All components will leverage the schema validation utilities from Phase 1 to ensure content integrity.

3. **File System Utilities**: All components will use the atomic file operations from Phase 1 for data persistence.

4. **Type Definitions**: All components will use the type definitions from Phase 1 for type safety.

5. **Concept Manager Patterns**: All new managers will follow the patterns established by the Concept Manager in Phase 2.

6. **Query Operations**: All new managers will integrate with the query operations from Phase 2 for filtering and searching.

7. **Index Management**: All new managers will integrate with the index management from Phase 2 for efficient lookups.
