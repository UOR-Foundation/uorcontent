# Next.js Integration Tests Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive integration testing strategy for the Next.js frontend application in the UOR Content Management Client repository. The testing approach follows Stone's role-based development methodology, ensuring proper validation of all components and their interactions with the MCP server.

## Testing Roles

Following Stone's role-based approach, the integration tests are organized by the following roles:

1. **PM (Project Manager)**: Defines test requirements and acceptance criteria
2. **QA (Quality Assurance)**: Designs test cases and validation strategies
3. **Feature**: Implements test code and fixtures
4. **Auditor**: Reviews test results and identifies potential issues
5. **Actions**: Automates test execution and reporting

## Integration Test Categories

### 1. API Client Integration Tests

**PM Requirements:**
- Verify that the API client correctly communicates with the MCP server
- Ensure proper handling of successful responses and error conditions
- Validate request formatting and response parsing

**QA Test Cases:**
- Test successful API requests for all content types
- Test error handling for various error conditions
- Test request timeout handling
- Test request cancellation

**Feature Implementation:**
- Mock MCP server responses for testing
- Implement test fixtures for different content types
- Create test utilities for request/response validation

**Auditor Validation:**
- Verify test coverage for all API client functions
- Ensure proper error handling validation
- Check for edge case handling

**Actions Automation:**
- Run API client tests as part of CI/CD pipeline
- Generate test coverage reports

### 2. Component Integration Tests

**PM Requirements:**
- Verify that components correctly render data from the API
- Ensure proper handling of loading states and error conditions
- Validate user interactions with components

**QA Test Cases:**
- Test component rendering with mock data
- Test loading state rendering
- Test error state rendering
- Test user interactions (clicks, form submissions)

**Feature Implementation:**
- Create test fixtures for component testing
- Implement mock API responses for component tests
- Set up testing environment for React components

**Auditor Validation:**
- Verify test coverage for all components
- Ensure proper rendering of all UI states
- Check for accessibility issues

**Actions Automation:**
- Run component tests as part of CI/CD pipeline
- Generate component test coverage reports

### 3. End-to-End Integration Tests

**PM Requirements:**
- Verify that the frontend application works correctly as a whole
- Ensure proper navigation between pages
- Validate complete user workflows

**QA Test Cases:**
- Test navigation between all pages
- Test complete user workflows (view content, filter content)
- Test error handling in user workflows

**Feature Implementation:**
- Set up end-to-end testing environment
- Implement test fixtures for end-to-end tests
- Create test utilities for user workflow validation

**Auditor Validation:**
- Verify test coverage for all user workflows
- Ensure proper handling of all user interactions
- Check for performance issues

**Actions Automation:**
- Run end-to-end tests as part of CI/CD pipeline
- Generate end-to-end test coverage reports

## Test Implementation Details

### API Client Tests

```typescript
// Example API client test
describe('MCP API Client', () => {
  it('should make a POST request to the MCP API endpoint', async () => {
    const mockRequest = createMockMCPRequest('getConceptById', { id: 'test-123' });
    const mockResponse = createMockMCPResponse(mockRequest.id, { id: 'test-123', name: 'Test Concept' });
    
    (global.fetch as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValueOnce({
      json: jest.fn().mockResolvedValueOnce(mockResponse)
    });

    const result = await mcpClient(mockRequest);

    expect(global.fetch).toHaveBeenCalledWith('/api/mcp', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(mockRequest),
    });
    expect(result).toEqual(mockResponse);
  });
});
```

### Component Tests

```typescript
// Example component test
describe('ContentList Component', () => {
  it('should render content items when loaded successfully', async () => {
    const mockItems = [
      { id: 'test-1', name: 'Test Item 1', description: 'Description 1' },
      { id: 'test-2', name: 'Test Item 2', description: 'Description 2' },
    ];

    mockedMcpClient.mockResolvedValueOnce(
      createMockMCPResponse('test-id', mockItems)
    );

    render(<ContentList contentType="concepts" title="Test Concepts" />);

    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(screen.getByText('Test Item 1')).toBeInTheDocument();
      expect(screen.getByText('Description 1')).toBeInTheDocument();
      expect(screen.getByText('Test Item 2')).toBeInTheDocument();
      expect(screen.getByText('Description 2')).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
  });
});
```

### End-to-End Tests

```typescript
// Example end-to-end test
describe('Content Navigation', () => {
  it('should navigate between content pages', async () => {
    render(<App />);
    
    // Navigate to Concepts page
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Concepts'));
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(screen.getByText('UOR Concepts')).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
    
    // Navigate to Predicates page
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Predicates'));
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(screen.getByText('UOR Predicates')).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
  });
});
```

## Test Execution

The integration tests are executed as part of the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that all changes to the frontend application are properly validated before deployment. The tests are run using Jest and React Testing Library, with the following commands:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

## Test Coverage Requirements

The integration tests must achieve the following coverage targets:

- **API Client**: 100% coverage
- **Components**: 90% coverage
- **End-to-End**: 80% coverage

## Conclusion

This integration testing strategy ensures that the Next.js frontend application is properly validated against the Stone tool's role-based development methodology. By following this approach, we can ensure that the frontend application is fully functional and works as intended with all features.
