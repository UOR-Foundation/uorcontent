# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the specification for fixing the GitHub Pages deployment for the UOR Content Management Client repository. It follows the Stone tool's role-based development approach and provides comprehensive specifications for ensuring the GitHub Pages deployment works correctly.

## PM Role: Requirements and Acceptance Criteria

### User Stories

1. **Fix GitHub Pages Deployment**
   - As a developer, I want to fix the GitHub Pages deployment that is currently returning a 404 error.
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - The GitHub Pages site is accessible at https://uor-foundation.github.io/uorcontent/
     - The deployment process completes successfully without timeouts
     - The static export process handles all pages correctly

2. **Next.js Configuration Fix**
   - As a developer, I want to update the Next.js configuration to properly handle static export.
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - The Next.js configuration is updated to handle problematic pages during static export
     - The static export process completes successfully without timeouts
     - The build output is correctly configured for GitHub Pages

### Non-functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - The build and deployment process should complete within the GitHub Actions timeout limit
   - The static export process should handle all pages efficiently

2. **Maintainability**
   - The configuration should be easy to understand and maintain
   - The solution should follow Next.js best practices for static export

## QA Role: Test Plan

### Unit Tests

1. **Configuration Tests**
   - Test that the Next.js configuration correctly handles static export
   - Test that the exportPathMap function correctly defines the pages to export
   - Test that the staticPageGenerationTimeout is set correctly

2. **Build Process Tests**
   - Test that the build process completes successfully without timeouts
   - Test that the build output contains all necessary files
   - Test that the build output is correctly structured for GitHub Pages

### Integration Tests

1. **Deployment Tests**
   - Test that the GitHub Actions workflow successfully deploys to GitHub Pages
   - Test that the deployed application is accessible at https://uor-foundation.github.io/uorcontent/
   - Test that the deployed application functions correctly

### Test Environment Setup

1. **Local Development Environment**
   - Next.js development server
   - Local build process for testing static export
   - Test scripts for verifying build output

2. **CI Environment**
   - GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
   - GitHub Pages deployment for testing

## Feature Role: Implementation Guidelines

### Implementation Steps

1. **Next.js Configuration Update**
   - Update next.config.mjs to handle problematic pages during static export
   - Add exportPathMap function to control which pages are exported
   - Set staticPageGenerationTimeout to prevent build timeouts

2. **GitHub Actions Workflow Update**
   - Update the GitHub Actions workflow to use the correct output directory
   - Configure the workflow to handle the static export process correctly
   - Ensure the workflow has the correct permissions for GitHub Pages deployment

### Implementation Requirements

1. **Code Quality**
   - Follow Next.js best practices for static export
   - Ensure code is well-documented
   - Follow project coding standards

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize the static export process to prevent timeouts
   - Configure the build process for efficient static export

## Auditor Role: Verification Checklist

### Configuration Quality

1. **Next.js Configuration**
   - The Next.js configuration correctly handles static export
   - The exportPathMap function correctly defines the pages to export
   - The staticPageGenerationTimeout is set correctly

2. **GitHub Actions Workflow**
   - The workflow correctly builds and deploys the application
   - The workflow uses the correct output directory
   - The workflow has the correct permissions for GitHub Pages deployment

### Deployment Quality

1. **Deployment Reliability**
   - The deployment process completes successfully without timeouts
   - The deployment is repeatable and automated
   - The deployed application is accessible at https://uor-foundation.github.io/uorcontent/

2. **Deployment Performance**
   - The deployment process completes within the GitHub Actions timeout limit
   - The static export process handles all pages efficiently

## Actions Role: CI/CD Configuration

### GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
    paths:
      - 'frontend/**'
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18.x'
          cache: 'npm'
          cache-dependency-path: 'frontend/package-lock.json'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: cd frontend && npm ci
      
      - name: Lint
        run: cd frontend && npm run lint
      
      - name: Type check
        run: cd frontend && npm run type-check
      
      - name: Build
        run: cd frontend && npm run build
      
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4
      
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: './frontend/out'

  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

### Deployment Pipeline

1. **Build Stage**
   - Checkout code
   - Set up Node.js
   - Install dependencies
   - Lint code
   - Type check code
   - Build application
   - Upload artifact

2. **Deploy Stage**
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages
   - Verify deployment
   - Report deployment status

## Conclusion

This GitHub Pages deployment fix specification provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring the GitHub Pages deployment works correctly for the UOR Content Management Client repository. By following the Stone tool's role-based development approach, we can ensure that all aspects of the fix are covered, from requirements gathering to deployment.
