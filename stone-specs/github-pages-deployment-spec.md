## Overview

This document outlines the specification for implementing GitHub Pages deployment for the UOR Content Management Client repository. It follows the Stone tool's role-based development approach and provides comprehensive specifications for ensuring the quality and reliability of the GitHub Pages deployment implementation.

## PM Role: Requirements and Acceptance Criteria

### User Stories

1. **GitHub Pages Deployment**
   - As a developer, I want to deploy the frontend application to GitHub Pages.
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - The frontend application is successfully built and deployed to GitHub Pages
     - The deployment is automated through GitHub Actions
     - The deployment is triggered on push to the main branch
     - The deployment is also manually triggerable through workflow dispatch

2. **Static Export Configuration**
   - As a developer, I want the Next.js application to be properly configured for static export.
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - The Next.js configuration is updated to support static export
     - All necessary build scripts are configured
     - The application works correctly when deployed as a static site

3. **Deployment Verification**
   - As a developer, I want to verify that the deployment was successful.
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - The GitHub Pages site is accessible
     - The application functions correctly on the GitHub Pages site
     - The deployment status is reported in the GitHub Actions workflow

### Non-functional Requirements

## Actions Role: CI/CD Configuration

### GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
    paths:
      - 'frontend/**'
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18.x'
          cache: 'npm'
          cache-dependency-path: 'frontend/package-lock.json'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: cd frontend && npm ci
      
      - name: Lint
        run: cd frontend && npm run lint
      
      - name: Type check
        run: cd frontend && npm run type-check
      
      - name: Build
        run: cd frontend && npm run build
      
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4
      
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: './frontend/.next'

  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

### Deployment Pipeline

1. **Build Stage**
   - Checkout code
   - Set up Node.js
   - Install dependencies
   - Lint code
   - Type check code
   - Build application
   - Upload artifact

2. **Deploy Stage**
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages
   - Verify deployment
   - Report deployment status

## Conclusion

This GitHub Pages deployment specification provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring the quality and reliability of the GitHub Pages deployment for the UOR Content Management Client repository. By following the Stone tool's role-based development approach, we can ensure that all aspects of the deployment are covered, from requirements gathering to deployment.
