# GitHub Pages Deployment Tests Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the GitHub Pages deployment in the UOR Content Management Client repository. The testing approach follows Stone's role-based development methodology, ensuring proper validation of the deployment process and the deployed application.

## Testing Roles

Following Stone's role-based approach, the tests are organized by the following roles:

1. **PM (Project Manager)**: Defines test requirements and acceptance criteria
2. **QA (Quality Assurance)**: Designs test cases and validation strategies
3. **Feature**: Implements test code and fixtures
4. **Auditor**: Reviews test results and identifies potential issues
5. **Actions**: Automates test execution and reporting

## Test Categories

### 1. Build Process Tests

**PM Requirements:**
- Verify that the build process correctly generates static files for GitHub Pages
- Ensure proper handling of Next.js configuration for static export
- Validate that all necessary files are included in the build output

**QA Test Cases:**
- Test successful build process with default configuration
- Test build process with different environment variables
- Test build process with different Next.js configurations
- Test build output structure and content

**Feature Implementation:**
- Implement build scripts for testing
- Create test fixtures for different configurations
- Set up test environment for build process

**Auditor Validation:**
- Verify build output contains all necessary files
- Ensure proper formatting of build output
- Check for optimization of build output

**Actions Automation:**
- Run build tests as part of CI/CD pipeline
- Generate build test reports
- Verify build artifacts

### 2. Deployment Tests

**PM Requirements:**
- Verify that the GitHub Actions workflow correctly deploys to GitHub Pages
- Ensure proper handling of GitHub Pages configuration
- Validate that the deployed application is accessible and functions correctly

**QA Test Cases:**
- Test successful deployment to GitHub Pages
- Test deployment with different configurations
- Test accessibility of deployed application
- Test functionality of deployed application

**Feature Implementation:**
- Implement deployment scripts for testing
- Create test fixtures for different deployment scenarios
- Set up test environment for deployment

**Auditor Validation:**
- Verify deployment completes successfully
- Ensure proper configuration of GitHub Pages
- Check for security of deployment process

**Actions Automation:**
- Run deployment tests as part of CI/CD pipeline
- Generate deployment test reports
- Verify deployment status

### 3. End-to-End Tests

**PM Requirements:**
- Verify that the deployed application works correctly as a whole
- Ensure proper navigation and functionality on the deployed application
- Validate complete user workflows on the deployed application

**QA Test Cases:**
- Test navigation on the deployed application
- Test functionality on the deployed application
- Test user workflows on the deployed application
- Test performance of the deployed application

**Feature Implementation:**
- Implement end-to-end test scripts
- Create test fixtures for different user scenarios
- Set up test environment for end-to-end testing

**Auditor Validation:**
- Verify all user workflows work correctly
- Ensure proper handling of all user interactions
- Check for performance issues on the deployed application

**Actions Automation:**
- Run end-to-end tests as part of CI/CD pipeline
- Generate end-to-end test reports
- Verify application functionality

## Test Implementation Details

### Build Tests

```typescript
// Example build test
describe('Build Process', () => {
  it('should generate static files for GitHub Pages', async () => {
    // Set up test environment
    const buildOutput = await runBuildProcess();
    
    // Verify build output
    expect(buildOutput).toContain('index.html');
    expect(buildOutput).toContain('_next');
    expect(buildOutput).toContain('static');
  });
  
  it('should correctly configure Next.js for static export', async () => {
    // Set up test environment
    const nextConfig = await getNextConfig();
    
    // Verify Next.js configuration
    expect(nextConfig.output).toBe('export');
    expect(nextConfig.basePath).toBe('');
    expect(nextConfig.images.unoptimized).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

### Deployment Tests

```typescript
// Example deployment test
describe('Deployment Process', () => {
  it('should successfully deploy to GitHub Pages', async () => {
    // Set up test environment
    const deploymentResult = await runDeploymentProcess();
    
    // Verify deployment result
    expect(deploymentResult.status).toBe('success');
    expect(deploymentResult.url).toMatch(/https:\/\/uor-foundation\.github\.io\/uorcontent/);
  });
  
  it('should correctly configure GitHub Pages', async () => {
    // Set up test environment
    const pagesConfig = await getPagesConfig();
    
    // Verify GitHub Pages configuration
    expect(pagesConfig.source).toBe('gh-pages');
    expect(pagesConfig.url).toMatch(/https:\/\/uor-foundation\.github\.io\/uorcontent/);
  });
});
```

### End-to-End Tests

```typescript
// Example end-to-end test
describe('Deployed Application', () => {
  it('should load correctly on GitHub Pages', async () => {
    // Set up test environment
    const page = await navigateToDeployedApp();
    
    // Verify page content
    expect(await page.title()).toBe('UOR Content Management Client');
    expect(await page.isVisible('nav')).toBe(true);
    expect(await page.isVisible('main')).toBe(true);
  });
  
  it('should navigate between pages correctly', async () => {
    // Set up test environment
    const page = await navigateToDeployedApp();
    
    // Navigate to Concepts page
    await page.click('a[href="/concepts"]');
    
    // Verify navigation
    expect(await page.url()).toContain('/concepts');
    expect(await page.isVisible('h1')).toBe(true);
    expect(await page.textContent('h1')).toBe('UOR Concepts');
  });
});
```

## Test Execution

The tests are executed as part of the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that all changes to the GitHub Pages deployment are properly validated before deployment. The tests are run using Jest and Playwright, with the following commands:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run build tests
npm run test:build

# Run deployment tests
npm run test:deployment

# Run end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e
```

## Test Coverage Requirements

The tests must achieve the following coverage targets:

- **Build Process**: 100% coverage
- **Deployment Process**: 90% coverage
- **End-to-End**: 80% coverage

## Conclusion

This testing strategy ensures that the GitHub Pages deployment is properly validated against the Stone tool's role-based development methodology. By following this approach, we can ensure that the deployment process is fully functional and works as intended with all features.
