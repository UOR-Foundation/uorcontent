2. **Compliance Requirements**
   - Meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
   - Support major screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
   - Ensure proper color contrast ratios
   - Provide text alternatives for non-text content

3. **User Experience Requirements**
   - Maintain usability for all users regardless of ability
   - Provide clear focus indicators
   - Implement skip links for navigation
   - Support different input methods (keyboard, mouse, touch)

4. **Integration Requirements**
   - Seamless integration with Chakra UI's accessibility features
   - Compatibility with Next.js App Router
   - Support for React Query's loading states
   - Integration with error handling system

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Accessibility Hooks and Utilities**
   - Implement screen reader announcement hook
   - Create focus management utilities
   - Add accessibility testing utilities
   - Set up screen reader only styles

2. **Phase 2: Component Enhancements**
   - Add ARIA attributes to existing components
   - Implement keyboard navigation
   - Create accessible modal and dialog components
   - Add skip links for navigation

3. **Phase 3: Form Accessibility**
   - Enhance form controls with proper labels

   - Validate with screen readers
   - Test keyboard navigation
   - Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

## Success Criteria

1. All components have proper ARIA attributes
2. Application is fully navigable by keyboard
3. Screen readers can access all content and functionality
4. Focus management works correctly for modals and dialogs
5. Skip links are implemented for navigation
6. Color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards
7. Automated accessibility tests pass
8. Manual testing with screen readers confirms usability
9. Zero linting warnings or errors
10. Successful integration with Chakra UI and Next.js

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Incomplete ARIA implementation | Use automated testing tools like axe-core |
| Keyboard traps | Implement and test focus management carefully |
| Screen reader compatibility issues | Test with multiple screen readers |
| Color contrast issues | Use Chakra UI's built-in accessible color schemes |
