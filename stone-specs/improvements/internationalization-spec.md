# Internationalization Implementation Specification

**Role**: PM  
**Date**: May 8, 2025  
**Feature**: Internationalization (i18n) Support  
**Branch**: devin/1746716283-frontend-improvements  

## Overview

This specification outlines the implementation of internationalization (i18n) support for the UOR Content Management Client. The i18n system will enable multi-language content, localized formatting, and a seamless user experience across different languages and regions.

## Requirements

1. **Core Functionality**
   - Implement i18n framework for text translation
   - Support multiple languages with easy addition of new languages
   - Enable language switching without page reload
   - Implement localized date, number, and currency formatting

2. **User Experience Requirements**
   - Provide language selection UI
   - Persist language preference across sessions
   - Support right-to-left (RTL) languages
   - Maintain consistent layout across languages

3. **Content Requirements**
   - Extract all UI text to translation files
   - Support pluralization and context-based translations
   - Enable dynamic content translation
   - Support HTML content in translations

4. **Integration Requirements**
   - Seamless integration with Next.js App Router
   - Compatibility with Chakra UI components
   - Support for server-side rendering
   - Integration with authentication system

## User Stories

### As a developer, I want to:

1. Translate UI text using a simple API.
2. Format dates and numbers according to the user's locale.
3. Support pluralization in translations.
4. Switch between languages programmatically.

### As a user, I want to:

1. View the application in my preferred language.
2. Switch between available languages easily.
3. See dates, numbers, and currencies formatted according to my locale.
4. Have a consistent experience regardless of the selected language.

## Technical Specifications

### i18n Framework Implementation

1. **i18n Provider Setup**
2. **i18n Provider Component**
3. **Translation Hook**
4. **Formatters Hook**

### Language Selector Component

1. **Language Selector Implementation**

### Translation Files Structure

1. **English Translations (Base Language)**
2. **Additional Language Translations**

### RTL Support

1. **Chakra UI RTL Configuration**
2. **RTL Provider Component**

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: i18n Framework Setup**
   - Install i18n dependencies
   - Configure i18n provider
   - Set up translation hooks
   - Create base translation files

2. **Phase 2: Component Internationalization**
   - Extract UI text to translation files
   - Update components to use translation hooks
   - Implement formatters for dates and numbers
   - Add language selector component

3. **Phase 3: RTL Support**
   - Configure Chakra UI for RTL support
   - Implement RTL provider
   - Test layout in RTL mode
   - Fix any RTL-specific styling issues

4. **Phase 4: Content Internationalization**
   - Implement dynamic content translation
   - Add support for HTML content in translations
   - Implement pluralization and context-based translations
   - Create translation files for all supported languages

5. **Phase 5: Testing and Validation**
   - Test translations in all supported languages
   - Validate RTL layout
   - Test formatters with different locales
   - Ensure proper integration with Next.js and Chakra UI

## Success Criteria

1. Application UI is fully translatable
2. Multiple languages are supported with easy switching
3. Language preference is persisted across sessions
4. Dates, numbers, and currencies are properly formatted
5. RTL languages are properly supported
6. Translations are complete for all supported languages
7. Dynamic content is properly translated
8. Pluralization and context-based translations work correctly
9. Zero linting warnings or errors
10. Successful integration with Next.js and Chakra UI

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Incomplete translations | Use translation management system and automated checks |
| Layout issues in RTL mode | Test thoroughly with RTL languages |
| Performance impact of translation files | Implement code splitting for translations |
| Missing context in translations | Provide detailed context for translators |
