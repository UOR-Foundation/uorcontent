# Progressive Web App Implementation Specification

**Role**: PM  
**Date**: May 8, 2025  
**Feature**: Progressive Web App (PWA) Configuration  
**Branch**: devin/1746716283-frontend-improvements  

## Overview

This specification outlines the implementation of Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for the UOR Content Management Client. The PWA configuration will enable offline access, installation on devices, and a native-like experience, improving user engagement and accessibility.

## Requirements

1. **Core Functionality**
   - Implement service worker for offline support
   - Create manifest.json for app installation
   - Add offline fallback pages
   - Implement background sync for offline operations

2. **User Experience Requirements**
   - Provide app installation prompts
   - Support offline access to critical content
   - Implement push notifications for important updates
   - Ensure smooth transitions between online and offline states

3. **Performance Requirements**
   - Implement app shell architecture
   - Enable precaching of critical assets
   - Optimize loading performance
   - Implement resource prioritization

4. **Integration Requirements**
   - Seamless integration with Next.js App Router
   - Compatibility with React Query's caching
   - Support for authentication in offline mode
   - Integration with error handling system

## User Stories

### As a developer, I want to:

1. Configure the application as a PWA with minimal setup.
2. Implement offline fallback pages.
3. Add background sync for offline operations.
4. Implement push notifications.

### As a user, I want to:

1. Install the application on my device.
2. Access content when offline.
3. Receive notifications for important updates.
4. Have a seamless experience regardless of network status.

## Technical Specifications

### PWA Configuration

1. **Web App Manifest**
2. **Next.js PWA Configuration**
3. **Service Worker Registration**

### Offline Support

1. **Offline Page**
2. **Network Status Hook**
3. **Offline Indicator**

### Background Sync

1. **IndexedDB Storage**
2. **Sync Manager Integration**
3. **Retry Logic for Failed Operations**

### Push Notifications

1. **Notification Permission Management**
2. **Push Subscription Management**
3. **Notification Display**

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Basic PWA Setup**
   - Install PWA dependencies
   - Configure manifest.json
   - Set up service worker
   - Implement offline page

2. **Phase 2: Offline Support**
   - Implement network status detection
   - Create offline indicator
   - Add offline fallback content
   - Implement caching strategies

3. **Phase 3: Background Sync**
   - Set up IndexedDB for offline data storage
   - Implement background sync registration
   - Create retry logic for failed operations
   - Add sync status indicators

4. **Phase 4: Push Notifications**
   - Implement notification permission flow
   - Set up push subscription management
   - Create notification display components
   - Add notification preferences

5. **Phase 5: Testing and Validation**
   - Test installation on various devices
   - Validate offline functionality
   - Test background sync
   - Ensure push notifications work correctly

## Success Criteria

1. Application can be installed on devices
2. Critical content is accessible offline
3. Failed operations are retried when online
4. Push notifications are delivered correctly
5. Smooth transitions between online and offline states
6. Precaching improves loading performance
7. App shell architecture provides instant loading
8. Comprehensive test coverage for PWA features
9. Zero linting warnings or errors
10. Successful integration with Next.js and React Query

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Browser compatibility issues | Test on multiple browsers and provide fallbacks |
| Service worker update issues | Implement proper update flow with notifications |
| Push notification permission denial | Provide clear value proposition before requesting |
| Excessive offline storage | Implement storage limits and cleanup strategies |
