# Next.js App Router Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of a Next.js application with App Router in the UOR Content Management Client repository. The implementation follows the specifications outlined in the Stone tool documentation and provides a modern frontend interface for interacting with UOR content.

## Implementation Details

### Installation Location

After analyzing the repository structure, we decided to install the Next.js application in a separate `frontend` directory at the repository root. This approach provides:

- Clear separation between frontend and backend code
- Reduced risk of conflicts with existing code
- Easier maintenance of separate build processes
- Ability to leverage existing TypeScript types and utilities

### Installation Process

1. Created detailed specifications using Stone tool
2. Installed Next.js with App Router in the `frontend` directory
3. Configured TypeScript path aliases for shared types
4. Created API client for MCP server communication
5. Updated the home page with UOR content management UI
6. Added development scripts to root package.json
7. Created environment configuration for MCP server URL

### Key Components

1. **API Client**: Created in `src/api/client.ts` for communication with the MCP server
2. **MCP API Route**: Implemented in `src/app/api/mcp/route.ts` to handle MCP requests
3. **Shared Types**: Defined in `src/types/shared.ts` for consistent type definitions
4. **Home Page**: Updated in `src/app/page.tsx` with UOR content management UI
5. **Environment Configuration**: Added in `.env.local` for MCP server URL

### Integration with Existing Codebase

The Next.js application is integrated with the existing TypeScript codebase through:

1. **Development Scripts**: Added to root package.json for frontend development
2. **API Integration**: Configured to communicate with the MCP server
3. **Type Definitions**: Shared between frontend and backend

## Testing

The implementation can be tested by:

1. Running the development server: `npm run dev:frontend`
2. Accessing the application at http://localhost:3000
3. Verifying API communication with the MCP server

## Conclusion

The Next.js application with App Router has been successfully installed in the UOR Content Management Client repository. The implementation follows the Stone tool specifications and provides a solid foundation for developing a modern frontend interface for UOR content management.
