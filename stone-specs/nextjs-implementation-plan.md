# Next.js Implementation Plan

## PM Role: Requirements and Specifications

### Feature Description
Integrate a Next.js application with App Router into the UOR Content Management Client repository to provide a modern frontend interface for interacting with UOR content.

### User Stories
1. As a developer, I want to install a Next.js application with App Router in the repository so that I can build a modern frontend interface.
2. As a developer, I want the Next.js application to be properly integrated with the existing TypeScript codebase so that I can leverage existing types and utilities.
3. As a developer, I want the Next.js application to communicate with the MCP server so that I can access UOR content management capabilities.
4. As a developer, I want clear documentation on how to run and develop the frontend application so that I can contribute effectively.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Next.js application with App Router is installed in a separate `frontend` directory
2. TypeScript configuration is properly set up to access shared types and utilities
3. API client is implemented for communication with the MCP server
4. Development scripts are added to package.json for frontend development
5. Documentation is updated to include frontend setup instructions
6. All linting requirements are satisfied with zero warnings

### Technical Constraints
1. Must use Next.js with App Router
2. Must maintain compatibility with existing TypeScript configuration
3. Must follow repository code standards and linting requirements
4. Must not break existing functionality

## QA Role: Test Plan

### Unit Tests
1. Test frontend components using Jest and React Testing Library
2. Test API client for proper request/response handling
3. Test TypeScript integration with shared types and utilities

### Integration Tests
1. Test communication between frontend and MCP server
2. Test data flow between frontend components and backend services
3. Test error handling and edge cases

### End-to-End Tests
1. Test complete user workflows from frontend to backend
2. Test deployment and build processes
3. Test performance and accessibility

### Test Environment Setup
1. Configure Jest for frontend testing
2. Set up mock server for API testing
3. Configure end-to-end testing with Cypress or Playwright

└── next.config.js
```

### Implementation Steps
1. Create frontend directory and install Next.js with App Router
   ```bash
   mkdir -p frontend
   cd frontend
   npx create-next-app@latest . --app --typescript --eslint --tailwind --src-dir --import-alias "@/*"
   ```

2. Configure TypeScript path aliases in frontend/tsconfig.json
   ```json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "paths": {
         "@/*": ["./src/*"],
         "@shared/*": ["../src/models/*", "../src/types.ts"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Create API client for MCP server communication
   ```typescript
   // src/api/client.ts
   import { MCPRequest, MCPResponse } from '@shared/types';

   export async function mcpClient<T>(request: MCPRequest): Promise<MCPResponse<T>> {
     const response = await fetch('/api/mcp', {
       method: 'POST',
       headers: {
         'Content-Type': 'application/json',
       },
       body: JSON.stringify(request),
     });
     
     return response.json();
   }
   ```

4. Add development scripts to root package.json
   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "dev:frontend": "cd frontend && npm run dev",
       "build:frontend": "cd frontend && npm run build",
       "start:frontend": "cd frontend && npm run start"
     }
   }
   ```

5. Update documentation to include frontend setup instructions
