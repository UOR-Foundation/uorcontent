# Next.js Integration Testing Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Next.js application with App Router in the UOR Content Management Client repository. It follows the Stone tool's role-based development approach and provides comprehensive test specifications for ensuring the quality and reliability of the frontend implementation.

## PM Role: Requirements and Acceptance Criteria

### User Stories

1. **Content Browsing**
   - As a content manager, I want to browse UOR concepts, predicates, resources, and topics through a modern web interface.
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - The home page displays navigation links to all content types
     - Each content type has a dedicated page with a list view
     - Content items can be selected for detailed viewing

2. **MCP Server Communication**
   - As a developer, I want the frontend to communicate seamlessly with the MCP server.
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - API requests follow the JSON-RPC format
     - Error handling is implemented for failed requests
     - Response data is properly typed and validated

3. **TypeScript Integration**
   - As a developer, I want the frontend to leverage existing TypeScript types from the backend.
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - Shared types are accessible in the frontend
     - Type checking passes with strict mode enabled
     - No type-related errors in the codebase

### Non-functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Page load time should be under 1 second for the home page
   - API requests should complete within 500ms

2. **Accessibility**
   - The application should meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
   - All interactive elements should be keyboard accessible

3. **Browser Compatibility**
   - The application should work in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge

## QA Role: Test Plan

### Unit Tests

1. **API Client Tests**
   - Test successful API requests
   - Test error handling for failed requests
   - Test request/response type validation

2. **Component Tests**
   - Test rendering of navigation components
   - Test content list components
   - Test content detail components

### Integration Tests

1. **API Integration Tests**
   - Test communication with the MCP server
   - Test handling of various response scenarios
   - Test error recovery and retry mechanisms

2. **Routing Tests**
   - Test navigation between pages
   - Test URL parameter handling
   - Test 404 handling for invalid routes

### End-to-End Tests

1. **User Flow Tests**
   - Test complete user journeys for browsing content
   - Test content management operations
   - Test error scenarios and recovery

2. **Performance Tests**
   - Test page load performance
   - Test API request performance
   - Test rendering performance for large content sets

### Test Environment Setup

1. **Local Development Environment**
   - Next.js development server
   - Mock MCP server for isolated testing
   - Test database with sample content

2. **CI Environment**
   - Automated test runs on pull requests
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Accessibility testing

## Feature Role: Implementation Guidelines

### Test Implementation

1. **Testing Libraries**
   - Jest for unit and integration tests
   - React Testing Library for component tests
   - Cypress for end-to-end tests
   - Lighthouse for performance testing

2. **Test Structure**
   - Tests should be organized by feature
   - Each test file should focus on a single component or functionality
   - Test utilities should be shared across test files

3. **Mocking Strategy**
   - API requests should be mocked using MSW (Mock Service Worker)
   - Browser APIs should be mocked when necessary
   - Test data should be generated using factories

### Test Coverage Requirements

1. **Code Coverage**
   - Minimum 80% code coverage for unit tests
   - Minimum 70% code coverage for integration tests
   - Critical paths should have 100% coverage

2. **Functional Coverage**
   - All user stories should have corresponding tests
   - All acceptance criteria should be verified by tests
   - All error scenarios should be tested

## Auditor Role: Verification Checklist

### Code Quality

1. **Linting**
   - ESLint rules should be followed
   - No TypeScript errors or warnings
   - Code formatting should follow Prettier rules

2. **Best Practices**
   - Components should follow React best practices
   - API client should follow HTTP best practices
   - State management should follow recommended patterns

3. **Documentation**
   - Code should be well-documented
   - Tests should have clear descriptions
   - README should include testing instructions

### Test Quality

1. **Test Reliability**
   - Tests should be deterministic
   - Tests should not depend on external services
   - Tests should clean up after themselves

2. **Test Maintainability**
   - Tests should be easy to understand
   - Tests should be easy to update
   - Test utilities should be reusable

3. **Test Performance**
   - Tests should run quickly
   - Tests should not consume excessive resources
   - Tests should be parallelizable when possible

## Actions Role: CI/CD Configuration

### GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: Next.js Frontend Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
    paths:
      - 'frontend/**'
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
    paths:
      - 'frontend/**'

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18.x'
          cache: 'npm'
          cache-dependency-path: 'frontend/package-lock.json'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: cd frontend && npm ci
      - name: Lint
        run: cd frontend && npm run lint
      - name: Type check
        run: cd frontend && npm run type-check
      - name: Run tests
        run: cd frontend && npm test
      - name: Build
        run: cd frontend && npm run build
```

### Deployment Pipeline

1. **Staging Deployment**
   - Automatic deployment to staging environment on successful PR merge
   - Smoke tests run against staging environment
   - Performance tests run against staging environment

2. **Production Deployment**
   - Manual approval required for production deployment
   - Canary deployment to subset of users
   - Rollback mechanism for failed deployments

## Conclusion

This testing specification provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring the quality and reliability of the Next.js application with App Router in the UOR Content Management Client repository. By following the Stone tool's role-based development approach, we can ensure that all aspects of testing are covered, from requirements gathering to deployment.
