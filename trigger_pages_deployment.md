# Trigger GitHub Pages Deployment

This file is created to trigger the GitHub Pages deployment workflow. The GitHub Pages site should be accessible at https://uor-foundation.github.io/uorcontent/ after the deployment is complete.

## Deployment Status

The GitHub Pages deployment is configured to use the GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/pages.yml`. The workflow is triggered on push to the main branch and can also be manually triggered through workflow dispatch.

## Verification

The deployment can be verified by:
1. Checking the GitHub Actions workflow status
2. Verifying that the GitHub Pages site is accessible at https://uor-foundation.github.io/uorcontent/
3. Testing the functionality of the deployed application
