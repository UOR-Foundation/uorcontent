```

### 3.2 Test Types

#### 3.2.1 Unit Tests

Unit tests will focus on testing individual components in isolation:

- **Core Components**: ContentRepository, SchemaValidator, FileSystem
- **Managers**: ConceptManager, PredicateManager, ResourceManager, TopicManager
- **Utils**: Validation utilities, file system utilities
- **Server Components**: API endpoints, middleware
- **CLI Components**: Command handlers, CLI utilities

#### 3.2.2 Integration Tests

Integration tests will verify interactions between components:

- Content managers with ContentRepository
- API endpoints with managers
- CLI commands with managers
- Validation with content operations

#### 3.2.3 End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests will validate complete workflows:

- API endpoints from request to response
- CLI commands from input to output
- Content operations from user action to storage

#### 3.2.4 Performance Tests

Performance tests will benchmark critical operations:

- Content creation, retrieval, update, and deletion
- Query operations with different providers
- Index management with incremental updates
- Bulk operations

### 3.3 Test Fixtures and Mocks

#### 3.3.1 Test Fixtures

Test fixtures will provide consistent test data:

- Valid and invalid concepts
- Valid and invalid predicates
- Valid and invalid resources
- Valid and invalid topics
- Index fixtures

#### 3.3.2 Mocks

Mock implementations will isolate components:

- FileSystem mock
- SchemaValidator mock
- EventEmitter mock
- HTTP request/response mocks

### 3.4 Test Utilities

Test utilities will provide common functionality:

- Fixture loading
- Test environment setup
- Mock creation
- Test data generation

### 3.5 Continuous Integration

CI setup will ensure consistent testing:

- GitHub Actions workflow
- Test runs on pull requests
- Code coverage reporting
- Linting checks
