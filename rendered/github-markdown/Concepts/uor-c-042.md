# Universal Number Field Operations

The fundamental field operations on universal numbers defined in terms of their prime-coordinate representations, forming a complete field structure.

## Definition

Universal numbers form a field with precisely defined operations that extend the fundamental operations on prime-coordinates:

For universal numbers `α, β ∈ 𝕌` with prime-coordinate representations `φ(α) = (a₁, a₂, ...)` and `φ(β) = (b₁, b₂, ...)`:

1. Addition: `φ(α + β) = log(exp(φ(α)) + exp(φ(β)))`
   Where exp and log operate componentwise on the prime-coordinate vectors

2. Multiplication: `φ(α · β) = φ(α) + φ(β)`
   Direct vector addition in the prime-coordinate space

3. Additive Inverse: `φ(-α) = log(exp(0) - exp(φ(α)))`
   Where 0 represents the zero vector in coordinate space

4. Multiplicative Inverse: `φ(α⁻¹) = -φ(α)`
   Negation of each coordinate in the prime-coordinate representation

These operations satisfy the field axioms and maintain consistency with both complex and p-adic interpretations.

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
\text{For universal numbers } \alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{U} \text{ with prime-coordinate representations}
$$

$$
\phi(\alpha) = (a_1, a_2, \ldots) \text{ and } \phi(\beta) = (b_1, b_2, \ldots):
$$

$$
\text{1. Addition: } \phi(\alpha + \beta) = \log(\exp(\phi(\alpha)) + \exp(\phi(\beta)))
$$

$$
\text{2. Multiplication: } \phi(\alpha \cdot \beta) = \phi(\alpha) + \phi(\beta)
$$

$$
\text{3. Additive Inverse: } \phi(-\alpha) = \log(\exp(0) - \exp(\phi(\alpha)))
$$

$$
\text{4. Multiplicative Inverse: } \phi(\alpha^{-1}) = -\phi(\alpha)
$$
