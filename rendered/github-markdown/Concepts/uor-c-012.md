# Fiber Bundle

A mathematical structure that consists of a total space, base space, projection map, typical fiber, and structure group, used in UOR to model the relationship between objects and their representations.

## Definition

A fiber bundle (E, B, π, F, G) consists of a total space E, a base space B, a projection π: E → B mapping each point to its base, a typical fiber F (the space attached to each point in B), a structure group G (transformations of F preserving bundle structure), and local trivializations. The UOR framework achieves its full mathematical power through a hierarchical fiber bundle formulation that rigorously integrates object structure with observer perspectives.

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
(E, B, \pi, F, G)
