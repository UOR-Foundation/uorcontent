# Coherence Preservation Theorems

Fundamental mathematical theorems that establish the properties, guarantees, and constraints of coherence-preserving dynamical systems.

## Definition

Several fundamental theorems establish the properties of coherence-preserving dynamics:

Coherence Preservation Theorem (Theorem 1): For any coherence-preserving system, the set of states with coherence greater than a threshold c relative to reference state φ₀ forms a forward-invariant set.

This theorem ensures that once a system achieves a certain level of coherence, it cannot drop below that level under coherence-preserving dynamics.

Coherence Convergence Theorem (Theorem 2): Under appropriate conditions, coherence-preserving gradient dynamics converge to local maxima of the coherence function.

This theorem guarantees that certain classes of coherence-preserving systems eventually reach states of maximum coherence within their accessible region of state space.

Coherence Conservation Theorem (Theorem 3): For conservative coherence-preserving dynamics, there exist conserved quantities that are functions of both the system state and the reference state.

This theorem identifies invariants of motion for coherence-preserving systems, analogous to conservation laws in physical systems.

Coherence Fluctuation Theorem (Theorem 4): For stochastic coherence-preserving dynamics, the probability of coherence-decreasing trajectories decreases exponentially with the magnitude of the coherence decrease.

This theorem quantifies the statistical properties of fluctuations in coherence under noisy conditions, connecting to concepts from non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

$$

$$
\text{Theorem 1 (Coherence Preservation Theorem): For any coherence-preserving system,}
$$

$$
\text{the set of states with coherence greater than a threshold } c \text{ relative to reference}
$$

$$
\text{state } \phi_0 \text{ forms a forward-invariant set.}
$$

$$
\mathcal{S}_c = \{\phi | C(\phi, \phi_0) \geq c\} \text{ is forward-invariant under coherence-preserving dynamics.}
$$

$$
\text{Theorem 2 (Coherence Convergence Theorem): Under appropriate conditions,}
$$

$$
\text{coherence-preserving gradient dynamics converge to local maxima of the coherence function.}
$$

$$
\lim_{t \to \infty} \phi(t) \in \{\phi | \nabla_\phi C(\phi, \phi_0) = 0 \text{ and } \nabla^2_\phi C(\phi, \phi_0) \text{ is negative definite}\}
$$

$$

$$

$$
\text{dynamics, there exist conserved quantities that are functions of both the system state}
$$

$$
\text{and the reference state.}
$$

$$
\exists G(\phi, \phi_0) \text{ such that } \frac{d}{dt}G(\phi(t), \phi_0) = 0
$$

$$
\text{Theorem 4 (Coherence Fluctuation Theorem): For stochastic coherence-preserving dynamics,}
$$

$$
\text{the probability of coherence-decreasing trajectories decreases exponentially with the}
$$

$$
\text{magnitude of the coherence decrease.}
$$

$$
\frac{P(\Delta C < 0)}{P(\Delta C > 0)} \approx e^{-\gamma |\Delta C|} \text{ for } \Delta C = C(\phi(t+\Delta t), \phi_0) - C(\phi(t), \phi_0)
$$
