# Universal Representation Theorem

A fundamental theorem establishing that every universal number admits a canonical representation as a triple consisting of its complex value, p-adic expansions, and prime coordinate vector.

## Definition

Theorem 1 (Universal Representation): Every universal number η ∈ 𝕌 admits a canonical representation as a triple:

η = (z, (aₚ)ₚ∈ℙ, φ(η))

where:
- z ∈ ℂ is its complex value
- aₚ ∈ ℤₚ is its p-adic expansion for each prime p
- φ(η) is its prime coordinate vector

These representations satisfy rigorous compatibility conditions ensuring consistency across all embedded domains.

Universal numbers exhibit crucial meta-theoretical properties that establish their coherence within the UOR framework:

1. Category-Theoretic Universality: 𝕌 represents the universal completion of ℚ with respect to all possible completions, making it the terminal object in an appropriate category of number systems.

2. Model-Theoretic Completeness: The theory of universal numbers is model-complete when formalized in an appropriate multi-sorted logic accommodating both Archimedean and non-Archimedean aspects.

3. Information-Theoretic Optimality: The universal coordinate representation achieves minimal descriptive complexity for representing numbers across multiple domains.

4. Intrinsic Coordinate Invariance: The coordinate representation is invariant under automorphisms of the number system, reflecting intrinsic structural properties rather than arbitrary conventions.

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
\text{Theorem 1 (Universal Representation):}
$$

$$
\text{Every universal number } \eta \in \mathbb{U} \text{ admits a canonical representation as a triple:}
$$

$$
\eta = (z, (a_p)_{p \in \mathbb{P}}, \phi(\eta))
$$

$$
\text{where:}
$$

$$
z \in \mathbb{C} \text{ is its complex value}
$$

$$
a_p \in \mathbb{Z}_p \text{ is its p-adic expansion for each prime } p
$$

$$
\phi(\eta) \text{ is its prime coordinate vector}
$$
