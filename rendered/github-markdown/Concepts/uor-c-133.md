# Protocol Enhancements

The practical improvements and proven theorems that demonstrate how UOR-based networking protocols enhance conventional approaches, with examples including UOR-Enhanced DNS, Coherence-Preserving TCP, and Prime-Structured Routing.

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
ResolveUOR(name) = (IPv6(name), \phi(name))
$$

$$
DeliverCPTCP(\phi(I), S, D) = (data, c\_value)
$$

$$
RoutePS(S, D) = \operatorname{argmin}_{paths} \sum C_{loss}(path)
$$

$$
||\phi(I_{source}) - \phi(I_{destination})||_c < \varepsilon_{max}
$$
