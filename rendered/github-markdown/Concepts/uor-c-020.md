# Prime Space Geometry

The study of geometric structures that emerge from the prime-coordinate representation of objects, revealing patterns in their composition and relationships.

## Definition

The prime-coordinate representation induces a rich geometric structure that reveals deep patterns in object composition and relationships. These geometric structures provide powerful tools for analyzing patterns, relationships, and transformations across mathematical domains.

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
||φ(x)||
$$

$$
⟨φ(x),φ(y)⟩
$$

$$
d(x,y) = ||φ(x) - φ(y)||
$$
