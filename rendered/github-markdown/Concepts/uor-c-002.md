# Prime Decomposition

The factorization of an object into its irreducible components, providing a natural coordinate system that reveals inherent structure.

## Definition

The central insight of UOR is that prime factorization provides a natural, intrinsic coordinate system for objects: Every object has a unique factorization into irreducible components. This factorization reveals the object's inherent structure. The prime-coordinate representation linearizes multiplicative relationships. The resulting geometric structure unifies diverse mathematical domains.
