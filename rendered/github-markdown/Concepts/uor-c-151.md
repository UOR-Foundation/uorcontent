# Norm Minimality

The theorem establishing that among all possible factorizations of an object, the prime factorization uniquely minimizes the coherence norm, proven through the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
\text{For any factorization } x = f_1 \cdot f_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot f_m \text{ where each } f_i \text{ may be composite:}
$$

$$
\|x\|_c \leq \sum_{i=1}^{m} \|f_i\|_c
$$

$$
\text{with equality if and only if each } f_i \text{ is a prime or unit}
$$
