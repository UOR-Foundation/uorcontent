# Preservation Mechanisms

The mathematical and computational mechanisms that enable information preservation across different representations and transformations in the UOR framework.

## Definition

Information preservation in UOR is achieved through several mechanisms:

1. **Prime Structure Invariance:** The prime coordinate structure remains invariant under certain classes of transformations.

2. **Coherence Metric Conservation:** Appropriate transformations preserve coherence metrics across different representations.

3. **Structural Homeomorphisms:** Transformations maintain structural homeomorphisms between different representational spaces.

4. **Information Encoding:** Essential information is encoded in the relationships between prime factors rather than in specific representational details.

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
\text{UOR employs several mechanisms to achieve information preservation:}
$$

$$
\text{1. Prime Structure Invariance: The prime coordinate structure remains}
$$

$$
\text{   invariant under transformations. For signal } S \text{ and transformation } T:\
$$

$$
\forall p_i \in P_E(S):\; \exists p_j \in P_E(T(S)) \text{ such that } p_i \cong p_j
$$

$$
\text{   where } P_E \text{ is the set of essential primes and } \cong \text{ denotes structural equivalence.}
$$

$$
\text{2. Coherence Metric Conservation: Coherence measures are preserved.}
$$

$$
\text{   For coherence metric } d_C:\
$$

$$
d_C(\phi(S_1), \phi(S_2)) \approx d_C(\phi(T(S_1)), \phi(T(S_2)))
$$

$$
\text{   where } \phi \text{ is the prime coordinate mapping.}
$$

$$
\text{3. Structural Homeomorphisms: Transformations maintain structural maps.}
$$

$$
\exists h_T: X_S \to X_{T(S)} \text{ such that } h_T \text{ is a homeomorphism}
$$

$$
\text{   where } X_S \text{ is the topological space induced by } \phi(S)\text{.}
$$

$$
\text{4. Information Encoding: Information is encoded in relationships rather than}
$$

$$
\text{   specific values. If } R(p_i, p_j) \text{ represents a relationship:}
$$

$$
R(p_i, p_j) \text{ in } \phi(S) \implies R'(p_i', p_j') \text{ in } \phi(T(S))
$$

$$
\text{   where } R' \text{ is the equivalent relationship in the transformed space.}
$$

$$
\text{5. Preservation Operators: Special operators maintain essential information:}
$$

$$
P_T: \phi(S) \to \phi(T(S)) \text{ such that } I_E(\phi(S)) = I_E(P_T(\phi(S)))
$$

$$
\text{   where } I_E \text{ measures essential information content.}
$$

$$
\text{6. Coherence-Guided Transformation: Transformations follow coherence paths:}
$$

$$
T_{\text{opt}} = \arg\min_T \{d_C(\phi(S), \phi(T(S))) \mid T \in \mathcal{T}\}
$$

$$
\text{   where } \mathcal{T} \text{ is the set of valid transformations.}
$$

$$
\text{7. Invariant Extraction: Identifying and preserving invariant properties:}
$$

$$
\mathcal{I}(S) = \{I_1, I_2, \ldots, I_n\} \text{ where each } I_k \text{ is invariant under} T
$$

$$
\text{   such that } \mathcal{I}(S) = \mathcal{I}(T(S)) \text{ for essential invariants.}
$$
