# Algebraic Completeness

The property that the universal number field is computably algebraically closed, containing roots for all non-constant polynomials while maintaining effective computability.

## Definition

The universal number system achieves algebraic completeness while maintaining computability:

Theorem 2 (Effective Algebraic Closure): The field `𝕌` is computably algebraically closed, meaning:

1. Every non-constant polynomial `P(x) ∈ 𝕌[x]` has exactly as many roots (counting multiplicity) in `𝕌` as its degree
2. These roots are effectively computable through prime-coordinate algorithms
3. The algebraic closure preserves coherence with both Archimedean and non-Archimedean metrics

This theorem demonstrates that `𝕌` serves as an effective algebraically closed field, with roots representable through explicit prime-coordinate algorithms.

Theorem 8 (Effective Nullstellensatz): There exists an effective algorithm that, given any finite set of polynomials in `𝕌[x₁,...,xₙ]`, determines whether they have a common root in `𝕌ⁿ` and computes such a root if it exists.

$$

$$
\text{2. These roots are effectively computable through prime-coordinate algorithms}
$$
