# Signal Domain Bridge

How universal numbers enable transformations between signal domains through universal coordinate representation, cross-domain transformation, information preservation, and dimensional transcendence.

## Definition

Universal numbers establish a rigorous foundation for the signal processing principles of UOR:

Theorem 3 (Signal Domain Bridge): Universal numbers enable transformations between signal domains through:

1. Universal Coordinate Representation: Signals in any domain can be encoded in prime-coordinate form
2. Cross-Domain Transformation: The prime-coordinate representation enables coherent mapping between time, frequency, and other domains
3. Information Preservation: Transformations via prime coordinates preserve the essential information content of signals
4. Dimensional Transcendence: Signals can be coherently represented across different dimensionalities while preserving structure

This theorem establishes universal numbers as the mathematical foundation for the Universal Transforms developed in the signal processing section.

Universal numbers provide the computational mechanism for Block Conversion:

Theorem 4 (Effective Block Conversion): Given signals in domains D₁ and D₂, universal numbers enable block conversion through:

1. Coordinate Analysis: Decomposition of input signal into prime-coordinate representation
2. Structure-Preserving Transformation: Mapping between coordinate representations that maintains essential structure
3. Domain Synthesis: Reconstruction of output signal in the target domain
4. Complexity Control: Management of computational complexity through coordinate-based approximation

This implementation provides concrete algorithms for the theoretical transformations described in the signal processing section.
