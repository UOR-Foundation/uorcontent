# Universal Analysis Axioms

The set of coherence axioms for universal analysis that align with UOR principles, ensuring a consistent extension of classical analysis to the universal number domain.

## Definition

The theory of universal analysis satisfies coherence axioms that align with UOR principles:

Axiom A1 (Analytical Extension): Every complex analytic function with p-adic analytic counterparts extends uniquely to a universal analytic function.

Axiom A2 (Coordinate Analyticity): The prime-coordinate transformation Ï† preserves analyticity, mapping universal analytic functions to analytic operations on coordinate space.

Axiom A3 (Computational Effectiveness): Every universal analytic function admits effective algorithms for evaluation, differentiation, and integration to arbitrary precision.

Axiom A4 (Observer Invariance): Analytical properties of universal functions remain invariant under changes of observer reference frame, whether complex-analytic or p-adic.

These axioms ensure that universal analysis forms a coherent extension of classical analysis aligned with the UOR framework.

Through universal analysis, the rich traditions of complex analysis and p-adic analysis unite in a coherent framework, enabling analytical methods that work consistently across different number domains while maintaining full alignment with the UOR prime-coordinate principles.
