# Spatiotemporal Reference Frame

An integrated observer perspective that unifies spatial and temporal aspects of perception, defining how objects are decomposed and represented across both dimensions within the UOR framework.

## Definition

The Spatiotemporal Reference Frame concept extends the UOR framework's observer frame formalism to unify spatial and temporal perspectives into a single coherent viewpoint. While traditional UOR observer frames consider either spatial or temporal decompositions separately, a spatiotemporal reference frame integrates both dimensions, capturing how observers simultaneously perceive and decompose objects across space and time.

Formally, a spatiotemporal reference frame is defined by four components:

1. A spatial prime basis (ùìë‚Çõ) determining how objects are decomposed in space
2. A temporal prime basis (ùìë‚Çú) determining how processes are decomposed in time
3. A coupling operator (Œ¶‚Çõ‚Çú) that relates spatial and temporal primes
4. A weighting function (œâ) that assigns relative importance to different spatiotemporal prime combinations

This integrated structure provides several key capabilities that extend the UOR framework:

**Relativistic Perspective Integration**

The spatiotemporal reference frame naturally accommodates relativistic effects where different observers may disagree about the simultaneity of events or the spatial separation of objects. By coupling spatial and temporal decompositions, the frame captures how temporal perspectives affect spatial decompositions and vice versa.

For observers in relative motion, their spatiotemporal reference frames are related by transformations that preserve the underlying spatiotemporal manifold's structure while mixing spatial and temporal components according to well-defined rules derived from the coupling operator.

**Space-Time Trade-offs**

The weighting function within spatiotemporal reference frames enables the formal representation of space-time trade-offs in representation and computation. This function captures how observers may choose to represent certain phenomena with greater spatial detail and less temporal resolution, or vice versa, while maintaining overall coherence.

These trade-offs are particularly relevant in practical implementations of UOR systems, where computational resources must be allocated across spatial and temporal decompositions. The weighting function provides a principled approach to optimizing these allocations based on observer-specific priorities.

**Causal Consistency**

Spatiotemporal reference frames maintain causal consistency through constraints on the coupling operator that ensure temporal orderings of events remain consistent across allowable frame transformations. These constraints generate a causal cone structure within the spatiotemporal manifold, delimiting the regions that can be causally connected from a given reference point.

**Frame Transformation Rules**

Transformations between different spatiotemporal reference frames follow a group structure generated by fundamental operators that mix spatial and temporal components. These transformation operators preserve the spatiotemporal interval on the manifold while changing the relative weighting between spatial and temporal prime decompositions.

For observers with small relative velocities, these transformations approximate Galilean transformations. For observers with velocities approaching fundamental limits, they approach Lorentz transformations. In quantum contexts, they incorporate additional phases that account for quantum reference frame effects.

**Practical Applications**

Spatiotemporal reference frames provide a unified framework for addressing practical problems that span space and time, including:

- Modeling event recognition across different observer perspectives
- Predicting how temporal patterns transform under spatial reference frame shifts
- Analyzing how spatial patterns evolve through different temporal reference frames
- Establishing invariant properties that persist across all admissible spatiotemporal frames

This concept bridges the previously separate spatial and temporal aspects of the UOR framework, providing a coherent foundation for understanding how observers integrate spatial and temporal perspectives in their decomposition and representation of reality.

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
\mathcal{F}_{ST} = (\mathcal{B}_S, \mathcal{B}_T, \Phi_{ST}, \omega)
$$

$$
T_{\mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathcal{F}'} = \exp\left(\sum_{i,j} \theta_{ij} \hat{G}_{ij}\right)
$$

$$
\omega(p_i, \tau_j) = \frac{\exp(-\lambda \cdot d(p_i, \tau_j))}{\sum_{k,l} \exp(-\lambda \cdot d(p_k, \tau_l))}
$$
