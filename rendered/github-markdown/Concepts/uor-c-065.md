# Coherence Measurement

How universal numbers enable precise quantification of information coherence through measures of signal complexity, structural similarity, information preservation, and observer independence.

## Definition

Universal numbers enable precise quantification of information coherence:

Theorem 5 (Coherence Measurement): The prime-coordinate representation of universal numbers induces well-defined measures of:

1. Signal Complexity: The minimum description length required in the prime-coordinate representation
2. Structural Similarity: The coordinate-space distance between different signals
3. Information Preservation: The degree to which transformations preserve essential structure
4. Observer Independence: The invariance of information content across different observer frames

These measures provide rigorous metrics for the information coherence principles of UOR.
