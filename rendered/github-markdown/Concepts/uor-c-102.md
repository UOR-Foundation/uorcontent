# Preservation Principle

The fundamental principle in UOR that guarantees essential information structure and coherence are maintained across representational transformations.

## Definition

Information preservation is a fundamental principle in the UOR framework that distinguishes it from traditional approaches to signal processing. While conventional methods often accept information loss during transformations between different representations, UOR provides mathematical guarantees for preserving essential information structure.

For a signal `S` with transformations `T₁` and `T₂` producing representations `R₁` and `R₂`: `T₁(S) = R₁`, `T₂(S) = R₂`

Information preservation requires that there exists a recoverable mapping `M` such that: `M(R₁, R₂)` preserves the essential information content of `S`.

More formally, define information content function `I(·)` such that: `I(S) = I(M(R₁, R₂))`

This ensures that no essential information is lost during transformations.

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
\text{The Information Preservation Principle establishes that essential information}
$$

$$
\text{structure and coherence can be maintained across representational changes.}
$$

$$
\text{For a signal } S \text{ with transformations } T_1 \text{ and } T_2 \text{ producing}
$$

$$
\text{representations } R_1 \text{ and } R_2\text{:}
$$

$$
T_1(S) = R_1
$$

$$
T_2(S) = R_2
$$

$$
\text{Information preservation requires the existence of a recoverable mapping } M \text{ such that:}
$$

$$
M(R_1, R_2) \text{ preserves the essential information content of } S.
$$

$$
\text{More formally, define an information content function } I(\cdot) \text{ such that:}
$$

$$
I(S) = I(M(R_1, R_2))
$$

$$
\text{This ensures that no essential information is lost during transformations.}
$$

$$
\text{The principle can be formalized in terms of prime coordinates. If } \phi(S) \text{ is}
$$

$$
\text{the prime coordinate representation of } S\text{, then for any valid transformation } T\text{:}
$$

$$
\exists \phi_T \text{ such that } \phi(T(S)) = \phi_T(\phi(S)) \text{ and }
$$

$$
I(\phi(S)) = I(\phi_T(\phi(S)))
$$

$$
\text{where } I \text{ is the essential information content function.}
$$

$$
\text{The preservation principle guarantees that for any sequence of transformations}
$$

$$
T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_n\text{, there exists a recovery mapping } R \text{ such that:}
$$

$$
I(S) = I(R(T_n(\ldots T_2(T_1(S))\ldots)))
$$

$$
\text{This constitutes a fundamental differentiation from Shannon information theory,}
$$

$$
\text{which considers bits as fungible and without intrinsic structure.}
$$
