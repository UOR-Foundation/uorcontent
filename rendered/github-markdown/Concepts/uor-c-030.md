# Monoidal Structures and Coherence

The monoidal category structure enriching the UOR framework, with coherence conditions and braided structures for the prime-coordinate functor.

## Definition

The UOR framework is enriched by monoidal category structure:
- Monoidal Functor: The prime-coordinate map is a strong monoidal functor between (Obj, ⊗, 1) and (Mod, ⊕, 0).
- Coherence Conditions: These isomorphisms satisfy the pentagon and triangle coherence conditions.
- Braided Structure: When the composition in Obj is commutative, the prime-coordinate functor preserves the braiding.

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
\text{Monoidal functor: } \phi: (Obj, \otimes, 1) \to (Mod, \oplus, 0)
$$

$$
\phi(X \otimes Y) \cong \phi(X) \oplus \phi(Y) \text{ and } \phi(1) \cong 0
$$

$$
\text{Pentagon coherence: } \phi((X \otimes Y) \otimes Z) \cong \phi(X \otimes (Y \otimes Z)) \cong (\phi(X) \oplus \phi(Y)) \oplus \phi(Z) \cong \phi(X) \oplus (\phi(Y) \oplus \phi(Z))
$$

$$
\text{Triangle coherence: } \phi(1 \otimes X) \cong \phi(X) \cong \phi(X \otimes 1) \cong 0 \oplus \phi(X) \cong \phi(X) \cong \phi(X) \oplus 0
$$
