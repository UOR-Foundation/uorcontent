# Spectral Filtering

Techniques for isolating, extracting, or modifying specific components of an object's prime spectrum to enable analysis and transformation.

## Definition

The spectral view enables powerful analytical operations analogous to signal processing. A prime filter F_S with frequency set S ⊂ P acts on an object x as: F_S(x) = ∏_{p∈S} p^{φ(x)(p)}, extracting only the components with frequencies in S. A low-pass filter with cutoff N keeps only frequencies up to N: LP_N(x) = ∏_{p≤N} p^{φ(x)(p)}, approximating x with only its lower-frequency components. A band-pass filter with range [a,b] preserves frequencies in that range: BP_{a,b}(x) = ∏_{a≤p≤b} p^{φ(x)(p)}, isolating a specific portion of the spectrum.

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
F_S(x) = ∏_{p∈S} p^{φ(x)(p)}
$$

$$
LP_N(x) = ∏_{p≤N} p^{φ(x)(p)}
$$

$$
BP_{a,b}(x) = ∏_{a≤p≤b} p^{φ(x)(p)}
$$
