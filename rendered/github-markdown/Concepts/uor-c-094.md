# Block Conversion Definition

The formal mathematical definition of transformations between data blocks of different bit-widths that preserve essential information through prime coordinate representation.

## Definition

For a data block `B` with bit-width `n`, define its universal number representation as `φ(B)` in prime coordinates. The block conversion operation `C` from bit-width `n` to bit-width `m` is defined as:

`C_n→m: φₙ(B) → φₘ(B)`

Where `φₙ` is the representation in `n`-bit space and `φₘ` is the representation in `m`-bit space.

The conversion preserves the essential information content, meaning:

`I(φₙ(B)) = I(φₘ(B))`

Where `I` measures the essential information content of the representation.

This preservation property can be formally expressed in terms of the coherence metric:

`d_C(φₙ(B), φₘ(B)) = 0`

Where `d_C` is the coherence distance metric in the underlying prime coordinate space.

For conversions where exact preservation is not possible due to fundamental constraints, an approximate conversion can be defined:

`C_n→m(B) = arg min_B' d_C(φₙ(B), φₘ(B'))`

This ensures that the conversion minimizes information distortion even when perfect preservation is impossible.

$$

$$
