# Dimensional Basis

The concept that prime numbers form a complete basis for the universal number space, with each prime constituting an independent dimension in the coordinate space.

## Definition

Universal numbers embody the dimensional structure envisioned in UOR:

Theorem 2 (Dimensional Basis): The set of prime numbers forms a complete basis for the universal number space such that:

1. Each prime constitutes an independent dimension in the coordinate space
2. The full space of universal numbers is spanned by the prime dimensions
3. Coordinate values quantify extent along each prime dimension
4. Operations in the universal number space have natural coordinate interpretations

This dimensional interpretation enables powerful geometric intuitions about numerical relationships and operations.
