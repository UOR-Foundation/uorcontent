# General UOR Existence Theorem

A fundamental theorem establishing the existence and properties of the prime-coordinate functor in any unique factorization domain or GCD domain.

## Definition

Theorem (General UOR Existence): Let D be any UFD (or GCD domain satisfying factorization axioms). Then the prime-coordinate functor φ: D^× → ℤ^P is well-defined, exact, and admits an extension to polynomial rings D[x], localizations D_S, and formal power series D[[x]], preserving unique factorization in each case.

Concretely, UOR applies whenever a domain admits a notion of irreducible generators P and a UFD-like factorization property.

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
\text{Let } D \text{ be any UFD (or GCD domain satisfying factorization axioms).}
$$

$$
\text{Then the prime-coordinate functor } \phi: D^{\times} \to \mathbb{Z}^P \text{ is well-defined, exact,}
$$

$$
\text{and admits an extension to polynomial rings } D[x], \text{ localizations } D_S,
$$

$$
\text{and formal power series } D[[x]], \text{ preserving unique factorization in each case.}
$$
