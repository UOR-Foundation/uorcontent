# Number Field Extension

The extension of the UOR framework to algebraic number fields, where prime ideals serve as primes in the factorization and the prime coordinate map represents elements by their ideal factor exponents.

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
(\alpha) = P_1^{e_1} \cdot P_2^{e_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot P_n^{e_n}
$$

$$
\phi(\alpha) = [(P_1, e_1), (P_2, e_2), \ldots, (P_n, e_n)]
$$

$$
\phi(\alpha \cdot \beta) = \phi(\alpha) + \phi(\beta)
$$

$$
h_K = \dim(\mathbb{Z}^{P_K} / \text{Im}(\phi)) \text{ where } h_K \text{ is the class number}
$$
