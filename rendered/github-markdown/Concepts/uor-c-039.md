# Coordinate Computability

The property that the prime-coordinate representation of any computable universal number is effectively computable to arbitrary precision with bounded resources.

## Definition

Theorem 1 (Coordinate Computability): For any computable universal number η ∈ 𝕌:

1. The coordinate mapping φ(η) = (e₁, e₂, e₃, ...) is effectively computable
2. For any finite precision δ > 0, approximations of each coordinate e_i to within δ can be computed in time polynomial in log(1/δ) and i
3. The coordinate computations converge uniformly for all embedded number systems

This theorem establishes that the prime-coordinate representation serves as a computable bridge between different number systems.

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
\text{Theorem 1 (Coordinate Computability): For any computable universal number } \eta \in \mathbb{U}:
$$

$$
\text{1. The coordinate mapping } \phi(\eta) = (e_1, e_2, e_3, \ldots) \text{ is effectively computable}
$$

$$
\text{2. For any finite precision } \delta > 0, \text{ approximations of each coordinate } e_i \text{ to within } \delta
$$

$$
\text{can be computed in time polynomial in } \log(1/\delta) \text{ and } i
$$

$$
\text{3. The coordinate computations converge uniformly for all embedded number systems}
$$
