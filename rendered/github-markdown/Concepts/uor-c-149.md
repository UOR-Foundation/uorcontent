# Valuation Properties

The essential mathematical properties of the prime valuation function that establish its behavior for operations like multiplication, addition, and its values for special elements like units and primes.

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
1. v_p(xy) = v_p(x) + v_p(y) \text{ for all } x, y
$$

$$
2. v_p(x+y) \geq \min(v_p(x), v_p(y)) \text{ with equality when } v_p(x) \neq v_p(y)
$$

$$
3. v_p(1) = 0 \text{ for all primes } p
$$

$$
4. v_p(p) = 1 \text{ for prime } p
$$
