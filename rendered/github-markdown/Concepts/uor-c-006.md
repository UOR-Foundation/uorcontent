# Observer Reference Frames

Perspectives from which universal objects are observed, each providing a valid but potentially different interpretation of the same underlying prime structure.

## Definition

While observer reference frames may interpret the representation differently, the underlying prime structure remains objective. Different frames observe the same intrinsic prime decomposition, frame transformations preserve the canonical structure, and all valid observers agree on the factorization, even with different perspectives.
