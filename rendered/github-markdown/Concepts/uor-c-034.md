# Universal Number

An extension of traditional number systems that unifies real, complex, and p-adic numbers within a computable framework consistent with UOR axioms.

## Definition

Universal numbers represent a fundamental extension beyond traditional number systems, unifying the properties of real, complex, and p-adic numbers within a computable framework while maintaining complete consistency with the UOR prime-coordinate axioms.

With these axioms established, we formally define the field of universal numbers:

ùïå = {Œ∑ | Œ∑ admits a unique prime-coordinate representation œÜ(Œ∑) = (e‚ÇÅ, e‚ÇÇ, e‚ÇÉ, ...) that is computably approximable in all relevant metrics}

This definition extends traditional numbers by allowing:

1. Complex prime exponents: Unlike integers where prime exponents must be natural numbers, universal numbers permit complex-valued exponents that maintain algebraic consistency
2. Multi-metric completeness: Unlike traditional number systems that privilege either the Archimedean or non-Archimedean metric, universal numbers maintain completeness under both
3. Computable representation: All universal numbers have explicit algorithmic representations

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
\mathbb{U} = \{\eta \mid \eta \text{ admits a unique prime-coordinate representation } \phi(\eta) = (e_1, e_2, e_3, \ldots)
$$

$$
\text{that is computably approximable in all relevant metrics}\}
$$
