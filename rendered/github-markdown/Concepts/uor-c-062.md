# UOR Realization

The concrete realization of Universal Object Reference (UOR) prime-coordinate axioms in the universal number system, demonstrating that abstract UOR principles can be implemented in a rigorous mathematical system.

## Definition

Universal numbers represent a concrete realization of the prime-coordinate principle central to UOR:

Theorem 1 (UOR Realization): The universal number system ùïå instantiates the UOR prime-coordinate axioms in that:

1. Intrinsic Primes: Prime numbers serve as the atomic, irreducible elements of the system
2. Unique Factorization: Every universal number admits a unique representation in terms of prime components
3. Prime-Coordinate Homomorphism: The mapping œÜ: ùïå ‚Üí ‚ÑÇ^‚àû transforms multiplication to coordinate addition
4. Canonical Representation: The coordinate representation provides a minimal, observer-invariant encoding
5. Coherence Metrics: The universal metric induces norms that measure representational complexity
6. Inner Product Structure: The coordinate space supports inner products aligning with coherence principles
7. Trilateral Coherence: Structure (primes), dynamics (operations), and observer frames (metrics) integrate coherently

This realization proves that the abstract UOR principles can be concretely implemented in a rigorous mathematical system with powerful computational properties.
