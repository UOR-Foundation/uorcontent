# Canonical Factorization

The standard form for expressing any non-zero non-unit element in a Unique Factorization Domain as a product of a unit and prime powers, with distinct primes and finite exponents.

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
x = u \cdot p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_n^{e_n}
$$

$$
\text{where:}
$$

$$
u \text{ is a unit in } D
$$

$$
p_i \text{ are distinct primes in } D
$$

$$
e_i \text{ are exponents (valuations) of primes } p_i
$$

$$
\text{the product is finite (only finitely many primes have non-zero exponents)}
$$
