# Temporal Algebraic Properties

The mathematical properties of the time operator that ensure consistent temporal evolution while preserving essential coherence structures in the Universal Object Reference framework.

## Definition

The time operator satisfies important algebraic properties including composition, identity, inverses, and commutation with prime factorization.

Composition: The time evolution over two sequential intervals equals the evolution over the combined interval.
Identity: Zero time evolution leaves an object unchanged.
Inverses: Time reversal followed by the same forward evolution returns to the original state.
Commutation with prime factorization: The time operator has specific commutation relations with the prime factorization operation, ensuring coherence properties are preserved through temporal evolution.

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
\text{For time operator T, the following algebraic properties hold:}
$$

$$
\text{1. Composition: } T_{\Delta t_1} \circ T_{\Delta t_2} = T_{\Delta t_1 + \Delta t_2}
$$

$$
\text{2. Identity: } T_0 = I \text{ (identity operator)}
$$

$$
\text{3. Inverses: } T_{\Delta t} \circ T_{-\Delta t} = T_0 = I
$$

$$
\text{4. Commutation with prime factorization: If } P \text{ is the prime factorization operator,}
$$

$$
\text{then } P \circ T_{\Delta t} = T'_{\Delta t} \circ P \text{ where } T' \text{ is a modified time operator}
$$
