# Prime Valuation

The mathematical function that returns the highest power of a prime that divides an element, forming the basis for the prime-coordinate mapping in the UOR framework.

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
v_p(x) = \text{highest power of $p$ that divides $x$}
$$

$$
v_2(12) = 2 \text{ because } 2^2 \text{ divides } 12 \text{, but } 2^3 \text{ does not}
$$

$$
\phi(x) = (v_p(x))_p
$$
