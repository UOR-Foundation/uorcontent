# Euclidean Structure

The natural geometric structure inherited by prime-coordinate space from the coherence norm and inner product, providing measures of complexity and similarity.

## Definition

The prime-coordinate space inherits a natural Euclidean structure from the coherence norm and inner product. The coherence norm ||φ(x)|| measures the intrinsic complexity of an object. The inner product ⟨φ(x),φ(y)⟩ quantifies the degree of prime-factor similarity. Angles between coordinate vectors represent compositional relationships. Orthogonal objects have no common prime factors.

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
||φ(x)||
$$

$$
⟨φ(x),φ(y)⟩
$$
