# Spectral Interpretation

A perspective that reframes prime factorization as a frequency domain analysis, viewing mathematical objects through their prime frequency components.

## Definition

The spectral interpretation of UOR reframes prime factorization as a frequency domain analysis, providing a powerful analogy to signal processing and harmonic analysis. This perspective reveals deep structural patterns by viewing objects through the lens of their prime frequency components. The spectral interpretation begins with a formal analogy between prime decomposition and frequency analysis, including an isomorphism between multiplicative and additive structures, a spectral transform that converts between them, and a spectral basis where each prime represents a fundamental frequency mode.

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
φ: (ℕ₊, ×) → (⨁_p ℕ, +)
$$
