# Formal Supplement

A formal mathematical supplement to the UOR framework providing rigorous category-theoretic, sheaf-theoretic, and domain-theoretic extensions and formalizations.

The Formal Supplement provides rigorous mathematical formalizations and extensions of the UOR framework across several advanced domains of mathematics.

Beginning with the Unique Factorization Domain (UFD) Axiom, it formalizes the core requirement that every non-unit object in category ùí∞ admits a unique finite decomposition into irreducible objects (primes). This axiom establishes the foundation for the entire UOR framework.

The Category-Theoretic Formalization models ùí∞ as a monoidal category with composition as the tensor product. It defines the prime coordinate map œÜ as a strong monoidal functor from (ùí∞,‚àò,1) to (‚Ñ§^(P),+,0), which preserves tensor and unit. This functor is initial among all such homomorphisms, exhibiting a universal property where any other functor to an abelian group factors uniquely through œÜ.

From a Sheaf & Stack Perspective, observers form a fibered category (stack) over ùí∞, assigning to each object X the groupoid of frames R. The canonical frame section exhibits the total category as a trivial torsor, ensuring global coherence and flatness of the bundle.

The framework extends to Dedekind Domains lacking unique factorization by refining primes to prime ideals. Working in the category of fractional ideals restores the UFD axiom, with the UOR coordinate extending to the ideal class group.

Additional concepts include Base-Absolute Prime Coordinates (independent of any chosen basis or chart), Primary Decomposition in Modules (generalizing prime factorization for modules over Noetherian rings), and Universal Properties & Limits of UOR (showing that œÜ enjoys a universal mapping property).

Finally, the supplement presents case studies in pure mathematics, demonstrating the application of UOR concepts to polynomial rings, algebraic number theory, and group representation theory.
