# Intrinsic Primes

The fundamental building blocks of the UOR framework, serving as the irreducible elements from which all objects are composed and forming the basis for unique object representation.

Intrinsic primes form the fundamental building blocks of the UOR framework, serving as the irreducible elements from which all objects are composed.

An element p in a domain D is called an intrinsic prime if it satisfies these conditions: Irreducibility, where p cannot be expressed as a product of two non-unit elements in D; Non-unit status, where p is not a unit (invertible element) in D; and the Prime property, where if p divides a product ab, then p divides either a or b.

Intrinsic primes possess several critical features that make them suitable as a coordinate basis: Domain independence, as the concept generalizes across number systems, polynomials, and abstract domains; Uniqueness, where each prime represents a distinct, indivisible aspect of object structure; and Completeness, as the set of all primes is sufficient to express any object through composition.

Within the Universal Object Reference framework, intrinsic primes serve as: Coordinate axes, where each prime defines an independent dimension in object space; Information atoms, representing the smallest units of structural information; and Spectral components, functioning as fundamental frequencies in an object's composition.

This prime foundation ensures that every object has a canonical decomposition into its most basic constituents, enabling unambiguous reference and comparison across observer frames.
