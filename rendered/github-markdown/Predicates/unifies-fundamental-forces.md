# unifies fundamental forces

Relation indicating that a resource describes how the UOR framework potentially unifies fundamental forces, cosmological principles, and quantum gravity

## Predicate: unifies fundamental forces

**Value:** The resource describes how the UOR framework offers a unified approach to understanding fundamental forces, cosmological principles, and quantum gravity through the prime-coordinate representation, including the action principle, gauge theories, specific forces like electromagnetism and strong/weak forces, cosmological concepts, and a potential resolution to quantum gravity.
