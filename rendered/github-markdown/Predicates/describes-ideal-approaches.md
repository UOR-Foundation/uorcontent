# describes ideal-theoretic approaches

Relation indicating that a resource describes ideal-theoretic approaches to recover unique factorization

## Predicate: describes ideal-theoretic approaches

**Value:** The resource describes ideal-theoretic approaches to recover unique factorization, including localization techniques that focus on ring behavior at specific primes, ideal factorization in Dedekind domains where ideals factor uniquely even when elements don't, fractional ideal theory, class group structure as a measure of factorization failure, and local-global principles connecting localized behavior to global properties.
