# formalizes

The Coherence Inner Product Axiom resource formalizes the definition of the inner product on the prime coordinate space as ⟨v,w⟩ = ∑_p v(p)·w(p), along with its properties of symmetry, linearity, positive-definiteness, and the orthonormality of the prime basis that enables a complete Euclidean geometry
