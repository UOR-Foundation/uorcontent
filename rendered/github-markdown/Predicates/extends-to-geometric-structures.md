# extends to geometric structures

Relation indicating that a resource extends the UOR framework to geometric structures and continuous spaces

## Predicate: extends to geometric structures

**Value:** The resource extends the UOR framework to geometric structures and continuous spaces, utilizing differential geometry (differential forms, connection forms, curvature tensors), fiber bundle theory (principal bundles, associated vector bundles, Ehresmann connections), functional analysis (Hilbert spaces, operator formalism), and computational-logical frameworks.
