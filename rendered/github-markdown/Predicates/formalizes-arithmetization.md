# formalizes arithmetization via prime encoding

Relation indicating that a resource formalizes the arithmetization of syntax through prime-coordinate encoding

## Predicate: formalizes arithmetization via prime encoding

**Value:** The resource formalizes how the arithmetization of syntax provides the foundation for self-reference in formal systems through prime-coordinate encoding—a special case of the UOR map. This includes symbol encoding (assigning unique natural numbers to each symbol), string encoding (defining Gödel numbers using prime factorization), prime-coordinate representation (expressing encodings as vectors in exponent space), and natural extensions to encode formulae and proofs. This encoding satisfies the UOR homomorphism property, transforming concatenation into addition in prime-coordinate space, while maintaining unique decodability through the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.
