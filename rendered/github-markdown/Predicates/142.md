# defines

The Prime Coordinates resource defines the prime-coordinate map Ï† as a homomorphism that transforms objects into vectors in an exponent space, where each prime corresponds to a dimension

## Predicate: defines

**Value:** defines the mathematical function that assigns to each object its vector of prime exponents

**Description:** defines the mathematical function that assigns to each object its vector of prime exponents

**Targets:**

- [prime-coordinate-map](../Concepts/prime-coordinate-map.md)
