# establishes

The Universal Mapping Property Axiom resource establishes how this axiom connects to all other core axioms, confirming intrinsic primes as fundamental building blocks, depending on unique factorization, elevating the prime-coordinate homomorphism to canonical status, providing theoretical justification for canonical representation, aligning with coherence metrics, and supporting trilateral coherence
