# develops UOR interpretation of incompleteness

Relation indicating that a resource develops a novel UOR interpretation of Gödelian incompleteness through prime spectra and transcendence

## Predicate: develops UOR interpretation of incompleteness

**Value:** The resource develops a novel UOR interpretation of Gödelian incompleteness, viewing formal theories as coherent bundles of axioms with prime-coordinate representations and provability as coherence between a formula and the theory. The Transcendence Theorem establishes that for any coherent bundle of axioms, there exists a statement whose prime-coordinate representation necessarily transcends it. This reveals an inherent limitation in trilateral coherence when self-reference is admitted, demonstrating that incompleteness emerges naturally from the spectral properties of coherent information systems.
