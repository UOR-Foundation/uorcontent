# Bundle Connection

A mathematical structure on a fiber bundle that defines how to transport fibers along paths in the base space, used in UOR to relate prime exponents and observer frames.

## Definition

The UOR framework can be enriched with bundle connections. A connection ω₁ on the prime bundle defines how exponents vary across nearby primes: ω₁ = ∑_p ω_p ⊗ e_p where ω_p are 1-forms on the base and e_p are basis elements of the fiber. A connection ω₂ on the frame bundle specifies how observer frames relate: ω₂ ∈ Ω¹(E₂, g₂) where g₂ is the Lie algebra of G₂. The curvature F of a connection is F = dω + ω ∧ ω, measuring the noncommutativity of covariant derivatives. In standard UOR, the Level 1 bundle is flat (zero curvature), reflecting the independence of different prime factors, while the Level 2 bundle may have nonzero curvature, capturing how observer transformations may fail to commute.

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
\omega_1 = \sum_p \omega_p \otimes e_p
$$

$$
\omega_2 \in \Omega^1(E_2, g_2)
$$

$$
F = d\omega + \omega \wedge \omega
$$
