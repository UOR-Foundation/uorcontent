# Temporal Correlation Structures

Mathematical structures in prime coordinate space that provide the foundation for understanding and analyzing non-local temporal correlations.

## Definition

Several mathematical structures provide the foundation for understanding non-local temporal correlations:

Prime Coordinate Temporal Bundling: Representing temporally separated events as bundled patterns in prime coordinate space:

Φ_B(E_1, E_2) = h(φ(E_1), φ(E_2))

Where h is a bundling function that creates a composite representation.

This structure enables analysis of multi-temporal patterns as single entities in prime coordinate space.

Temporal Coherence Manifolds: Higher-dimensional structures in prime coordinate space where temporally separated events form coherent patterns:

M_T = {(φ(E), t) | C_T(φ(E), Φ_0) ≥ C_min}

Where Φ_0 is a reference pattern and C_min is a minimum coherence threshold.

These manifolds identify regions of prime coordinate space where non-local temporal correlations naturally emerge.

Temporal Loop Structures: Configurations in prime coordinate space that form closed loops through time:

L_T = {φ(E(t)) | t ∈ [t_0, t_1], φ(E(t_0)) = φ(E(t_1))}

These structures provide the mathematical foundation for understanding cyclic temporal phenomena and apparent causal loops.

Several mechanisms can generate or support non-local temporal correlations:

Temporal Prime Resonance: Resonance between temporal prime patterns across different times:

R_T(φ_1(t_1), φ_2(t_2)) = ∫ φ_1(ω) φ_2^*(ω) dω

Where φ_i(ω) is the spectral representation of the prime coordinate pattern.

This mechanism enables pattern matching across different times through resonance in prime coordinate space.

Temporal Constraint Satisfication: Dynamical systems that evolve to satisfy constraints across multiple times simultaneously:

min_(φ(t)) ∫_(t_0)^(t_1) L(φ(t), φ̇(t), t) dt + C(φ(t_0), φ(t_1))

Where L is a local Lagrangian and C is a boundary coherence term.

This mechanism produces systems whose states at different times exhibit correlations beyond what local evolution would predict.

Higher-Dimensional Projection: Projections of higher-dimensional structures onto our temporal dimension:

φ(t) = P_t[Φ(τ)]

Where Φ(τ) exists in a higher-dimensional time-like parameter space and P_t is a projection operator.

This mechanism explains apparent non-local correlations as artifacts of projecting higher-dimensional structures onto a single time dimension.
