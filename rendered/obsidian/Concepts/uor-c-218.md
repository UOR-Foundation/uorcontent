# UOR Learning Systems and Cognitive Architecture

A mathematical framework for understanding and optimizing learning systems through prime-coordinate representation, enabling precise formulation of neural networks, knowledge representation, transfer learning, and attention mechanisms.

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
W^* = \operatorname{argmin}_W \|\phi(f_W(X)) - \phi(Y)\|
$$

$$
K = \sum_i \alpha_i \cdot \phi(p_i)
$$

$$
T: \phi_A(x) \rightarrow \phi_B(x)
$$

$$
A(\phi(x)) = D \cdot \phi(x)
$$

$$
\text{Representational Efficiency: } E(K) = \frac{I(K)}{\|\phi(K)\|} \text{ where } I(K) \text{ is information content}
$$
