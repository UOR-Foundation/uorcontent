# Spectral Energy

## Description

A measure of the total energy in an object's spectral representation, defined as the squared [[uor-c-005|coherence norm]] of its prime-coordinate vector.

## Definition

The [[uor-c-010|spectral energy]] of an object is given by its squared [[uor-c-005|coherence norm]]: E(x) = ‖φ(x)‖² = ∑_p φ(x)(p)², analogous to Parseval's theorem in Fourier analysis. The [[uor-c-305|minimal energy principle]] states that among all representations of an object, the prime factorization minimizes the total [[uor-c-010|spectral energy]], showing that prime factorization is the most energy-efficient decomposition.

## Mathematical Formulation

$
E(x) = ‖φ(x)‖² = ∑_p φ(x)(p)²
$
