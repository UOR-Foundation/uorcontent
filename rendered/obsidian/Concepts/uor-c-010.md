# Spectral Energy

A measure of the total energy in an object's spectral representation, defined as the squared coherence norm of its prime-coordinate vector.

## Definition

The spectral energy of an object is given by its squared coherence norm: E(x) = ‖φ(x)‖² = ∑_p φ(x)(p)², analogous to Parseval's theorem in Fourier analysis. The minimal energy principle states that among all representations of an object, the prime factorization minimizes the total spectral energy, showing that prime factorization is the most energy-efficient decomposition.

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
E(x) = ‖φ(x)‖² = ∑_p φ(x)(p)²
$$
