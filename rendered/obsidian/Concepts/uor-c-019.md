# Observer-Invariant Properties

## Description

Properties of objects in the [[uor-c-001|UOR framework]] that remain unchanged regardless of the observer [[uor-c-313|reference frame]] from which they are described.

## Definition

Certain properties remain invariant across all valid observer frames: The cardinality of the [[uor-c-002|prime decomposition]] (number of distinct prime factors), the essential factorization pattern (which primes appear, if not their exact representation), the algebraic relationships between composed objects, and the topological features of the prime-coordinate space.
