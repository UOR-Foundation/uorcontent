# Temporal Correlation Theorems

## Description

Fundamental mathematical theorems that establish the properties, constraints, and conservation laws governing non-local temporal correlations.

## Definition

Several fundamental theorems establish the properties of non-local temporal correlations:

Temporal Correlation Bound Theorem (Theorem 1): For any two events separated by time interval Δt, the maximum possible correlation achievable through local causal mechanisms is bounded by a function that decreases with Δt.

This theorem establishes the baseline against which non-local correlations are measured.

Temporal Entanglement Conservation Theorem (Theorem 2): Under coherence-preserving dynamics, the total temporal entanglement within a closed system remains constant.

This theorem identifies conservation laws for temporal entanglement, analogous to conservation laws in physics.

[[uor-c-313|Reference Frame]] Invariance Theorem (Theorem 3): While the appearance of causality may change between temporal reference frames, the measure of temporal entanglement remains invariant under coherence-preserving temporal [[uor-c-018|frame transformations]].

This theorem ensures that the fundamental non-local properties of temporal correlations are observer-independent, even when their causal interpretation may vary.

Information Transfer Limit Theorem (Theorem 4): Non-local temporal correlations cannot be used to transfer arbitrary information from future to past at a rate exceeding the entropy production rate of the system.

This theorem places limits on apparent retrocausality, connecting it to thermodynamic principles.

## Mathematical Formulation

$
\text{Several fundamental theorems establish the properties of non-local temporal correlations:}
$

$
\text{Theorem 1 (Temporal Correlation Bound): For any two events separated by time}
$

$
\text{interval } \Delta t\text{, the maximum possible correlation achievable through local}
$

$
\text{causal mechanisms is bounded by a function that decreases with } \Delta t\text{.}
$

$
C_{max}^{local}(\Delta t) \leq f(\Delta t) \text{ where } \frac{df}{d\Delta t} < 0
$

$
\text{Theorem 2 (Temporal Entanglement Conservation): Under coherence-preserving}
$

$
\text{dynamics, the total temporal entanglement within a closed system remains constant.}
$

$
\frac{d}{dt}\int_\Omega E_T(\phi(x,t), \phi(y,t)) dx dy = 0 \text{ for closed domain } \Omega
$

$
\text{Theorem 3 (Reference Frame Invariance): While the appearance of causality may}
$

$
\text{change between temporal reference frames, the measure of temporal entanglement}
$

$
\text{remains invariant under coherence-preserving temporal frame transformations.}
$

$
E_T^{(F_1)}(E_1, E_2) = E_T^{(F_2)}(E_1, E_2) \text{ for all coherence-preserving } F_1 \to F_2
$

$
\text{Theorem 4 (Information Transfer Limit): Non-local temporal correlations cannot}
$

$
\text{be used to transfer arbitrary information from future to past at a rate exceeding}
$

$
\text{the entropy production rate of the system.}
$

$
I_{future \to past} \leq \dot{S}_{system}
$
