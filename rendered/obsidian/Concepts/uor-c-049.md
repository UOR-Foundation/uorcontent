# Topological Coherence Axioms

## Description

The set of axioms ensuring that the topological structure of universal numbers aligns with the [[uor-c-001|UOR framework]], providing coherence between different metrics and computational properties.

## Definition

The topological structure of universal numbers satisfies coherence axioms that align with the [[uor-c-001|UOR framework]]:

Axiom T1 (Multi-Metric Coherence): The Archimedean metric d_‚àû and all p-adic metrics d_p exist simultaneously and satisfy compatibility conditions ensuring their coherent coexistence.

Axiom T2 (Prime-Coordinate Continuity): The prime-coordinate map œÜ: ùïå ‚Üí ‚ÑÇ^‚àû is a homeomorphism onto its image with respect to appropriate topologies.

Axiom T3 (Observer-Invariant Completeness): Every Cauchy sequence converges in ùïå regardless of the metric (Archimedean or p-adic) used to define the Cauchy property.

Axiom T4 (Topological Computability): The topology supports effective computability, with open sets admitting algorithmic descriptions and continuous functions being effectively approximable.

These axioms ensure the topological structure aligns perfectly with the algebraic and computational aspects of universal numbers while maintaining full consistency with UOR principles.
