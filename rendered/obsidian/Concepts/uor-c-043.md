# Operational Lifting

The principle that all algebraic operations on universal numbers can be derived from corresponding operations on their prime-coordinate representations through the homomorphism φ.

## Definition

All algebraic operations on universal numbers derive from the prime-coordinate framework through the principle of "operational lifting":

Theorem 1 (Operational Lifting): Any algebraic operation on universal numbers can be expressed as a corresponding operation on their prime-coordinate representations through the homomorphism φ.

Proof involves the construction of a consistent algebraic structure that:
1. Preserves the multiplicative-to-additive mapping that characterizes φ
2. Extends addition through an appropriate "logarithmic-exponential bridge"
3. Ensures all field axioms are satisfied by the induced operations

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
\text{Theorem 1 (Operational Lifting): Any algebraic operation on universal numbers}
$$

$$
\text{can be expressed as a corresponding operation on their prime-coordinate}
$$

$$
\text{representations through the homomorphism } \phi.
