# Trilateral Coherence

## Description

The principle that every coherent description of an object must harmonize three aspects: intrinsic structure, dynamical rules, and observer frame.

## Definition

Every coherent description of an object must incorporate and harmonize three aspects: Intrinsic Structure (the object's canonical [[uor-c-002|prime decomposition]]), Dynamical Rules (the composition laws governing object interactions), and Observer Frame (the perspective from which the object is described). These three elements form an indivisible triad - changing any one necessitates adjustments in the others to maintain a coherent description.
