# Clifford Algebra Structure

An extension of the coherence inner product to a full Clifford algebra structure, providing powerful geometric tools for the UOR framework.

## Definition

By extending the coherence inner product to a full Clifford algebra structure, we gain access to powerful geometric tools:
- Multivector representations allow composite objects to be described using exterior products of prime basis elements
- Prime-coordinate transformations become operations in the Clifford algebra
- The geometric product combines inner products and exterior products into a unified algebraic structure

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
\text{For prime basis vectors } e_p \text{, the geometric product provides:}
$$

$$
e_p e_q = e_p \cdot e_q + e_p \wedge e_q
$$

$$
\text{where } e_p \cdot e_q \text{ is the inner product and } e_p \wedge e_q \text{ is the exterior product}
$$
