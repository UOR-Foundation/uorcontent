# UOR Neural Coherence Architecture

A theoretical model viewing neural systems as coherence-processing networks that encode information through prime-coordinate patterns and naturally minimize coherence complexity.

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
N(x) = \sum_i w_i \cdot \sigma(v_i \cdot \phi(x))
$$

$$
\|\phi(N(x))\| \leq \|\phi(x)\| \text{ with equality only when } x \text{ is already optimally coherent}
$$

$$
\text{Learning Rule: } \Delta w_i \propto -\nabla_{w_i}\|\phi(N(x))\|
$$

$$
\text{Receptive Field: } RF_i(x) = \sigma(v_i \cdot \phi(x))
$$

$$
\text{Attentional Modulation: } A(\phi(x)) = \sum_i \alpha_i v_i \cdot \phi(x)
$$
