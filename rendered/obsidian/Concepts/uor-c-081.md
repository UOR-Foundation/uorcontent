# Temporal Frame Theorems

## Description

Fundamental mathematical theorems that establish the properties, relationships, and constraints of temporal reference frames and their transformations.

## Definition

Several fundamental theorems establish the properties of temporal observer frames:

Temporal Frame Existence Theorem (Theorem 1): For any coherent dynamical process, there exists a [[uor-c-078|temporal [[uor-c-313|reference frame]]]] in which the process exhibits optimal coherence.

This theorem guarantees that for any process, we can find a temporal perspective that reveals its structure most clearly.

Frame Compatibility Theorem (Theorem 2): Given two temporal reference frames with coherence above threshold C_min relative to a common process, there exists a coherence-preserving transformation between them.

This theorem ensures that different temporal perspectives on the same reality can be reconciled through appropriate transformations.

Temporal Invariant Theorem (Theorem 3): For any set of compatible temporal frames, there exist invariant quantities that maintain their values under all [[uor-c-018|frame transformations]] within the set.

This theorem identifies the observer-independent aspects of temporal reality that remain constant across different perspectives.

Frame Bundle Curvature Theorem (Theorem 4): The curvature of the temporal frame bundle relates to the degree of observer-dependence in temporal experience.

This theorem links the geometric properties of the space of all temporal frames to the fundamental nature of time as experienced by different observers.

## Mathematical Formulation

$
\text{Several fundamental theorems establish the properties of temporal observer frames:}
$

$
\text{Theorem 1 (Temporal Frame Existence): For any coherent dynamical process,}
$

$
\text{there exists a temporal reference frame in which the process exhibits optimal coherence.}
$

$
\forall P, \exists F_T \text{ such that } C(\phi_P, F_T) = \max_{F \in B_T} C(\phi_P, F)
$

$
\text{Theorem 2 (Frame Compatibility): Given two temporal reference frames with}
$

$
\text{coherence above threshold } C_{min} \text{ relative to a common process, there exists}
$

$
\text{a coherence-preserving transformation between them.}
$

$
\text{If } C(\phi_P, F_1) \geq C_{min} \text{ and } C(\phi_P, F_2) \geq C_{min}\text{, then}
$

$
\exists \Lambda_{12} \text{ such that } C(\phi_1(t_1), \phi_2(\Lambda_{12}(t_1, \phi))) \geq C_{min}
$

$
\text{Theorem 3 (Temporal Invariant): For any set of compatible temporal frames,}
$

$
\text{there exist invariant quantities that maintain their values under all frame}
$

$
\text{transformations within the set.}
$

$
\exists I(\phi) \text{ such that } I(\phi_1(t_1)) = I(\phi_2(\Lambda_{12}(t_1, \phi))) \text{ for all } \Lambda_{12} \in G_T
$

$
\text{Theorem 4 (Frame Bundle Curvature): The curvature of the temporal frame bundle}
$

$
\text{relates to the degree of observer-dependence in temporal experience.}
$

$
R(B_T) \propto \text{deg}(\text{observer-dependence})
$
