# Topological Field

## Description

The property of universal numbers forming a [[uor-c-048|topological field]] with continuous operations with respect to the universal metric and all component metrics.

## Definition

Universal numbers form a [[uor-c-048|topological field]] with strong continuity properties:

Theorem 3 ([[uor-c-048|Topological Field]]): The field operations on ùïå are continuous with respect to the universal metric:

1. Addition: The map (Œ±, Œ≤) ‚Ü¶ Œ± + Œ≤ is continuous
2. Multiplication: The map (Œ±, Œ≤) ‚Ü¶ Œ± ¬∑ Œ≤ is continuous
3. Inversion: The map Œ± ‚Ü¶ Œ±^(-1) is continuous on ùïå \ {0}

Moreover, these operations maintain continuity with respect to each individual metric (Archimedean and p-adic), making ùïå simultaneously a complex [[uor-c-048|topological field]] and a p-adic [[uor-c-048|topological field]] for all primes p.

## Mathematical Formulation

$
\text{Theorem 3 (Topological Field): The field operations on } \mathbb{U} \text{ are}
$

$
\text{continuous with respect to the universal metric:}
$

$
\text{1. Addition: The map } (\alpha, \beta) \mapsto \alpha + \beta \text{ is continuous}
$

$
\text{2. Multiplication: The map } (\alpha, \beta) \mapsto \alpha \cdot \beta \text{ is continuous}
$

$
\text{3. Inversion: The map } \alpha \mapsto \alpha^{-1} \text{ is continuous on } \mathbb{U} \setminus \{0\}
$
