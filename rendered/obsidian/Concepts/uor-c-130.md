# Network Mapping Principles

## Description

The core principles that govern the translation from UOR theory to networking practice, including preservation of prime structure, coherence maintenance, and structural homomorphism.

## Mathematical Formulation

$
\Gamma(\phi(I)) = P(I)
$

$
C(\phi(I), \phi(P(I))) > \tau_{min}
$

$
P(op_{UOR}(I_1, I_2, ..., I_n)) = op_{NET}(P(I_1), P(I_2), ..., P(I_n))
$
