# Lorentz-Invariant Prime Decomposition

A relativistically consistent approach to prime decomposition that preserves the essential structure of objects across reference frames in relative motion, ensuring physical laws maintain their form in all admissible frames.

## Definition

Lorentz-Invariant Prime Decomposition extends the UOR framework's prime factorization principles to accommodate relativistic physics by ensuring decompositions remain consistent across reference frames in relative motion. While traditional prime decomposition treats space and time separately, this concept integrates them through tensor-structured prime elements that transform appropriately under the Lorentz group of special relativity.

The fundamental innovation of this approach is the definition of prime elements as tensorial objects in the spatiotemporal manifold rather than as scalar quantities. These tensorial primes transform covariantly under Lorentz transformations, ensuring that decompositions preserve their essential structure while adapting to the perspective of observers in relative motion.

Key aspects of Lorentz-invariant prime decomposition include:

**Tensor-Structured Prime Elements**

In this approach, prime elements are defined as rank-2 tensors in spacetime, with transformation properties that ensure their causal structure remains consistent across reference frames. The factorization of objects into these tensorial primes captures how their spatiotemporal patterns decompose into irreducible components that maintain their identity under relativistic transformations.

For observers in different reference frames, the specific components of these tensor primes will differ, but their overall structure and relationships will transform in ways that preserve the underlying physical reality. This ensures that physical laws expressed through prime decompositions maintain their form in all admissible frames.

**Invariant Interval Preservation**

A critical property of Lorentz-invariant prime decomposition is the preservation of the spacetime interval between events. The prime coordinate space is equipped with a metric that mirrors the Minkowski metric of special relativity, ensuring that distances in prime space transform appropriately under reference frame changes.

This preservation of intervals ensures that causally connected events remain causally connected in all reference frames, and that the light cone structure of spacetime is reflected in the prime decomposition structure. Time-like separated events maintain their temporal ordering, while space-like separated events may have frame-dependent orderings.

**Proper Time Parameterization**

Lorentz-invariant prime decomposition uses proper time (the time experienced in an object's rest frame) as the fundamental parameter for temporal evolution. This ensures that temporal developments are represented consistently across reference frames, regardless of relativistic time dilation effects.

The decomposition expresses how objects evolve along their world lines in terms of proper time, with the specific manifestation in any given reference frame derived through the appropriate Lorentz transformation. This approach naturally accommodates phenomena like time dilation and length contraction within the prime decomposition framework.

**Relativistic Composition Laws**

When combining objects with Lorentz-invariant prime decompositions, the composition laws must respect relativistic principles. The product operation in prime space incorporates tensor contraction that ensures results transform correctly under reference frame changes. Similarly, the coherence measures between decompositions are defined to be invariant under Lorentz transformations.

These relativistic composition laws enable the UOR framework to model interactions between objects in ways that respect the fundamental structure of spacetime, making it suitable for representing physical systems where relativistic effects are significant.

**Connection to Particle Physics**

Lorentz-invariant prime decomposition provides a natural framework for representing elementary particles and their interactions. The irreducible tensorial primes can be related to particle quantum numbers and symmetry properties, while their transformations under the Lorentz group connect to the spin and relativistic properties of fundamental particles.

This connection suggests that the UOR framework with Lorentz-invariant prime decomposition may offer new insights into particle classification and the structure of fundamental interactions, potentially unifying aspects of number theory with physical symmetry principles.

By integrating relativistic principles into the foundation of prime decomposition, this concept enables the UOR framework to represent physical reality in ways that respect the fundamental structure of spacetime while maintaining the universal object reference principles that give the framework its power and flexibility.

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
\mathcal{P}_L(x) = \prod_{\mu,\nu} {p_{\mu\nu}}^{\alpha_{\mu\nu}} \text{ where } p_{\mu\nu} \text{ are Lorentz-invariant prime elements}
$$

$$
p_{\mu\nu} \mapsto \Lambda^\alpha_\mu \Lambda^\beta_\nu p_{\alpha\beta} \text{ under Lorentz transformation } \Lambda
$$

$$
\mathcal{I}(x, y) = \eta_{\mu\nu}(x^\mu - y^\mu)(x^\nu - y^\nu) \text{ invariant interval in prime space}
$$
