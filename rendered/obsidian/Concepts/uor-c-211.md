# UOR Ideal-Theoretic Approaches

Mathematical techniques using ideal theory and localization to recover unique factorization in domains where elements themselves do not factor uniquely.

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
S^{-1}R = \{r/s \mid r \in R, s \in S\}/\sim
$$

$$
I = P_1^{e_1} \cdot P_2^{e_2} \cdot ... \cdot P_n^{e_n}
$$

$$
J = \{x \in K \mid \exists d \in R : dx \subset R\}
$$

$$
Cl(R) = J(R)/P(R)
$$

$$
[I] \cdot [J] = [IJ]
$$

$$
R \text{ is a UFD } \iff R_P \text{ is a UFD for all prime ideals } P \text{ and } Cl(R) = 0
$$
