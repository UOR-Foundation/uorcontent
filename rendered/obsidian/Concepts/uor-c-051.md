# Universal Integration

## Description

A unified approach to integration in the [[uor-c-034|universal number]] domain that simultaneously represents complex contour integrals and collections of p-adic integrals.

## Definition

[[uor-c-051|Universal integration]] unifies complex and p-adic integration:

Definition 2 (Universal Integral): For a function f: 𝕌 → 𝕌 and a path γ, the universal line integral is defined as:

`∫_γ f(η) dη`

which simultaneously represents a complex contour integral and a collection of p-adic integrals.

Theorem 3 (Fundamental Theorem of Universal Calculus): If f: 𝕌 → 𝕌 is a universally differentiable function and γ is a path from a to b, then:

`∫_γ f'(η) dη = f(b) - f(a)`

This theorem generalizes both the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and its p-adic analogues.

Theorem 10 (Universal Residue Theorem): For a universally meromorphic function f and a closed contour γ encircling isolated singularities:

`Integral_γ f(η) dη = 2πi × Sum of Res(f, α_j)`

where the residues have both complex and p-adic interpretations.

## Mathematical Formulation

$
\text{Definition 2 (Universal Integral): For a function } f: \mathbb{U} \to \mathbb{U}
$

$
\text{and a path } \gamma, \text{ the universal line integral is defined as:}
$

$
\int_{\gamma} f(\eta) d\eta
$

$
\text{which simultaneously represents a complex contour integral and a collection of p-adic integrals.}
$

$
\text{Theorem 3 (Fundamental Theorem of Universal Calculus): If } f: \mathbb{U} \to \mathbb{U}
$

$
\text{is a universally differentiable function and } \gamma \text{ is a path from } a \text{ to } b, \text{ then:}
$

$
\int_{\gamma} f'(\eta) d\eta = f(b) - f(a)
$
