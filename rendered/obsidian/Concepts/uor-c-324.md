# Spatiotemporal Manifold

A unified geometric structure integrating spatial and temporal dimensions within the prime coordinate space, providing a coherent representation of objects across spatiotemporal reference frames.

## Definition

The Spatiotemporal Manifold concept establishes a unified geometric structure that integrates spatial and temporal dimensions within the UOR framework's prime coordinate space. Rather than treating space and time as separate domains with distinct prime decompositions, this concept recognizes their fundamental interconnection through a coherent manifold structure where spatial primes and temporal primes interact through well-defined operations.

Formally, the spatiotemporal manifold is defined as a product space of spatial prime coordinates and temporal prime operators, extended with coupling coefficients that capture their interdependencies. These coupling coefficients characterize how spatial representations evolve over time and how temporal processes manifest across spatial configurations. The manifold is equipped with a coherence metric that measures the alignment of spatiotemporal patterns across different observer reference frames.

This integrated structure resolves several theoretical challenges in the UOR framework:

1. **Frame Reconciliation**: It provides a principled mechanism for reconciling observer frames with different spatiotemporal perspectives, generalizing both spatial frame transformations and temporal frame transformations through a unified coherence-preserving operator.

2. **Causal Structure**: The spatiotemporal manifold induces a natural causal structure through the directionality of temporal prime operators, establishing consistent ordering relations between events in prime coordinate space.

3. **Invariant Dynamics**: By coupling spatial and temporal primes, it enables the formulation of invariant dynamical laws that maintain their structure across different observer frames while accommodating frame-dependent manifestations.

4. **Coherence Propagation**: It explains how coherence measures evolve through time, with spatial coherence patterns transforming according to temporal prime factorizations.

The geometry of the spatiotemporal manifold exhibits several distinctive features:

- Locally, it resembles a product space of spatial and temporal dimensions
- Globally, it may have non-trivial topological structure depending on the coupling patterns between spatial and temporal primes
- For observer frames in relative motion, the manifold applies hyperbolic transformations to maintain invariant spatiotemporal intervals
- Near coherence singularities, the manifold geometry becomes non-Euclidean, reflecting the complex interplay of spatial and temporal primes in these regions

This concept provides a theoretical foundation for understanding how observer-dependent experiences of space and time emerge from the more fundamental structure of prime coordinate space. It bridges the abstract mathematical formalism of UOR with physical interpretations related to spacetime geometry, while extending beyond classical spacetime to incorporate quantum and informational aspects of spatiotemporal relationships.

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
\mathcal{M}_{ST} = \{(p_i, \tau_j, \alpha_{ij}) | p_i \in \mathcal{P}, \tau_j \in \mathcal{T}, \alpha_{ij} \in \mathbb{C}\}
$$

$$
\mathcal{C}_{ST}(x, y) = \int_{\mathcal{M}_{ST}} K(x, z) \cdot K(z, y) \, d\mu(z)
$$
