# Mathematics as Reality

The principle that mathematical structures don't merely describe reality but constitute it, where the abstract and concrete converge in prime-coordinate representation with patterns of pure number directly manifesting as physical existence.

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
\text{Reality } R = \{\phi : \phi \text{ is a coherent prime-coordinate structure}\}
$$

$$
\forall x \in \text{Physical}, \exists \phi \in \text{Mathematical} : x = \text{realization}(\phi)
$$

$$
\text{Physical Law } L \cong \text{Coherence Constraint } C_\phi
$$

$$
\text{Theory Correspondence: } T_1 \cong T_2 \iff \phi(T_1) = \phi(T_2)
$$

$$
\text{Realization Function: } R(M) = \{x : \phi(x) = M\}
$$
