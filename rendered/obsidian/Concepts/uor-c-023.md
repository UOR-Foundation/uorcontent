# Coherence Metric

A geometric measure that defines notions of distance and proximity between objects in prime-coordinate space based on their factorization similarity.

## Definition

The coherence metric defines notions of distance and proximity between objects. d(x,y) = ||φ(x) - φ(y)|| measures compositional distance. Neighborhoods contain objects with similar prime factorization. Geodesics represent minimal paths between objects in prime-coordinate space. Curvature appears when considering non-Euclidean coherence measures.

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
d(x,y) = ||φ(x) - φ(y)||
$$
