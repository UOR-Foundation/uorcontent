# Observer Invariance

## Description

The property of a representation system that ensures descriptions remain consistent regardless of observer perspective or encoding choices.

## Definition

UOR addresses a fundamental challenge in mathematics and physics: how to provide a canonical, observer-invariant representation for objects across diverse domains. Traditional representation systems face several limitations including observer-dependence leading to ambiguous descriptions. The [[uor-c-001|UOR framework]] offers invariance as a significant advantage, providing representation independent of arbitrary encoding choices.
