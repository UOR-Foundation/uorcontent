# Coherence Preservation Condition

The mathematical criteria that define when temporal evolution maintains or enhances the structural coherence of objects in prime coordinate space.

## Definition

For any object O evolving under dynamics D, the coherence preservation condition is:

d/dt C(φ(O(t)), φ(O(t₀))) ≥ 0

Where C is the coherence function measuring similarity in prime coordinate space, φ(O(t)) is the prime coordinate representation at time t, and t_0 is a reference time.

This condition ensures that the coherence between the current and reference states does not decrease over time.

A stronger condition requires that coherence increases monotonically:

d/dt C(φ(O(t)), φ(O(t₀))) > 0

Systems satisfying this condition exhibit coherence enhancement, where structure becomes progressively more organized and coherent over time.

For infinitesimal time steps, the local coherence preservation condition is:

∇_φ C(φ, φ₀) · φ̇ ≥ 0

Where ∇_φ C is the gradient of the coherence function in prime coordinate space, and φ̇ is the rate of change of the prime coordinates.

A vector field F on the prime coordinate space is coherence-preserving with respect to reference state φ_0 if:

∇_φ C(φ, φ₀) · F(φ) ≥ 0 for all φ

The coherence function serves as a Lyapunov function for coherence-preserving dynamics:

C(φ(t), φ₀) ≥ C(φ(t₀), φ₀) for all t ≥ t₀

## Mathematical Formulation

$$
\text{For any object } O \text{ evolving under dynamics } D\text{, the coherence preservation condition is:}
$$

$$
\frac{d}{dt} C(\phi(O(t)), \phi(O(t_0))) \geq 0
$$

$$
\text{Where } C \text{ is the coherence function measuring similarity in prime coordinate space,}
$$

$$
\phi(O(t)) \text{ is the prime coordinate representation at time } t\text{, and}
$$

$$
t_0 \text{ is a reference time.}
$$

$$
\text{Strong coherence preservation requires:}
$$

$$
\frac{d}{dt} C(\phi(O(t)), \phi(O(t_0))) > 0
$$

$$
\text{For infinitesimal time steps, the local coherence preservation condition is:}
$$

$$
\nabla_{\phi} C(\phi, \phi_0) \cdot \dot{\phi} \geq 0
$$

$$
\text{A vector field } F \text{ is coherence-preserving if:}
$$

$$
\nabla_{\phi} C(\phi, \phi_0) \cdot F(\phi) \geq 0 \text{ for all } \phi
$$
