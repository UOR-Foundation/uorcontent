# presents neural coherence model

Relation indicating that a resource presents a model of neural systems as coherence-processing networks

## Predicate: presents neural coherence model

**Value:** The resource presents a precise model of neural systems as coherence-processing networks featuring prime-coordinate neural coding (where neurons encode information through distributed prime-coordinate patterns), synaptical factor decomposition (neural networks naturally decomposing complex signals into prime factors), and the emergent coherence theorem (demonstrating that neuronal systems naturally converge toward minimal-coherence representations).
