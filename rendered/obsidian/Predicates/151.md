# establishes

The Coherence Norm resource establishes the Minimality Theorem proving that among all possible factorizations of an object, the prime factorization achieves the minimal coherence norm, based on the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality

## Predicate: establishes

**Value:** establishes that prime factorization uniquely minimizes the coherence norm

**Description:** establishes that prime factorization uniquely minimizes the coherence norm

**Targets:**
