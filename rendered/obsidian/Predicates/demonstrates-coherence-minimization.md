# demonstrates coherence minimization

Relation indicating that a resource demonstrates coherence minimization as a universal optimization principle

## Predicate: demonstrates coherence minimization

**Value:** The resource demonstrates coherence minimization as a universal optimization principle operating across diverse domains, connecting to information theory (relation to Kolmogorov complexity), evolutionary dynamics (fitness proportional to negative coherence complexity), algorithmic convergence (learning algorithms naturally discovering prime-like decompositions), and quantum interpretation (superposition as multi-frame coherence and entanglement as prime-coordinate correlation).
