# formalizes UFD axiom

## Description

Relation indicating that a resource formally defines and explains the [[uor-c-301|Unique Factorization]] Domain axiom in the [[uor-c-001|UOR framework]]

## Predicate: formalizes UFD axiom

**Value:** The resource formalizes the Unique Factorization Domain (UFD) axiom, which provides the mathematical foundation for the UOR framework by requiring that every non-unit object in a category with finite products admits a unique finite decomposition into irreducible objects (primes).
