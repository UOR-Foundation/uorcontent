# establishes first incompleteness theorem

Relation indicating that a resource establishes Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem and its formal proof

## Predicate: establishes first incompleteness theorem

**Value:** The resource establishes Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem, which emerges as a consequence of self-reference. By applying the Diagonal Lemma to the formula expressing non-provability, we obtain a sentence that essentially asserts "I am not provable in theory T." The theorem proves that for any consistent, recursively axiomatizable theory extending Peano Arithmetic, this sentence is independent of the theory—neither it nor its negation can be proven. This demonstrates that no such theory can be complete, establishing a fundamental limitation of formal mathematics.
