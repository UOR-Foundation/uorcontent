# formulates quantum coherence systems

## Description

Relation indicating that a resource formulates a mathematical framework for quantum information processing based on prime-coordinate principles

## Predicate: formulates quantum coherence systems

**Value:** The resource formulates a mathematical framework that applies prime-coordinate principles to quantum information processing, including error correction topology (constructing quantum error correction codes through prime-coordinate symmetries), entanglement as prime-coordinate coupling (quantifying entanglement through coupled prime coordinates), algorithm complexity reduction (optimizing quantum algorithms through prime decomposition), and the quantum advantage theorem (formalizing how quantum speedup scales exponentially for problems with highly entangled prime structure).
