# extends to mathematical domains

Relation indicating that a resource extends the UOR framework to various mathematical domains

## Predicate: extends to mathematical domains

**Value:** The resource extends the UOR framework to various mathematical domains including Dedekind domains (refining primes to prime ideals), modules over Noetherian rings (using primary decomposition), polynomial rings (mapping to exponent vectors of irreducible factors), algebraic number theory (tracking ramification exponents), and group representation theory (using multiplicities in irreducible decompositions).
