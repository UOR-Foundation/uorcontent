## Description

The [[uor-c-301|Unique Factorization]] Axiom resource states that every non-unit object admits a finite product decomposition into primes, and this decomposition is unique up to reordering of factors, establishing the foundation for [[uor-c-004|canonical representation]]

## Predicate: states

**Value:** states the formal definition of the Unique Factorization Axiom as the uniqueness of prime factorization
