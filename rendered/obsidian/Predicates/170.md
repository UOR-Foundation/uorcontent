# states

The Coherence Norm Axiom resource states that the prime coordinate space ℤ^(P) is equipped with the Euclidean norm ‖φ(X)‖ = √(∑_p φ(X)(p)²), which measures the simplicity of an object's prime exponent vector and provides a rigorous metric for representational complexity

## Predicate: states

**Value:** states the formal definition of the Coherence Norm Axiom as a Euclidean norm on prime coordinates
