# formalizes

## Description

The [[uor-c-308|Coherence Inner Product]] Axiom resource formalizes the definition of the inner product on the prime coordinate space as ⟨v,w⟩ = ∑_p v(p)·w(p), along with its properties of symmetry, linearity, positive-definiteness, and the orthonormality of the prime basis that enables a complete Euclidean geometry

## Predicate: formalizes
