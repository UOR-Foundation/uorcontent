# states

The Prime-Coordinate Homomorphism Axiom resource states that there exists an injective homomorphism φ: 𝒰 → ℤ^(P) mapping each object to its exponent vector over primes, satisfying φ(X∘Y)=φ(X)+φ(Y), establishing the crucial bridge between object composition and vector addition

## Predicate: states

**Value:** states the formal definition of the Prime-Coordinate Homomorphism Axiom as an injective structure-preserving mapping
