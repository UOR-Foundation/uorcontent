# provides category-theoretic model

## Description

Relation indicating that a resource provides a formal category-theoretic model of the [[uor-c-001|UOR framework]]

## Predicate: provides category-theoretic model

**Value:** The resource provides a rigorous category-theoretic model of the UOR framework, formalizing the prime coordinate map as a strong monoidal functor from the original category to the free abelian group generated by primes, with universal properties that establish it as the canonical way to assign coordinates based on prime factorization.
