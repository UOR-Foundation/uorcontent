# analyzes complex social and economic systems

Relation indicating that a resource analyzes complex social and economic systems through prime-coordinate representation and coherence principles

## Predicate: analyzes complex social and economic systems

**Value:** The resource demonstrates how social and economic systems naturally organize according to coherence principles, including network community detection (social communities emerging through prime-coordinate clustering), market equilibrium theory (economic equilibria representing coherence minima in transaction space), organizational information flow (optimal structures minimizing information coherence cost), and consensus formation dynamics (group decision-making processes following coherence minimization pathways).
