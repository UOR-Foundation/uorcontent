# grounds value in coherence

Relation indicating that a resource grounds ethical and aesthetic values in coherence principles

## Predicate: grounds value in coherence

**Value:** The resource establishes that ethical and aesthetic values find grounding in coherence principles. Beauty corresponds to optimal information compression (representing significant complexity through minimal prime factors), and moral goods align with actions that preserve coherence across multiple frames (maintaining or enhancing coherence across diverse perspectives). This provides an approach to values that neither reduces them to subjective preferences nor places them in a separate non-natural realm, but identifies them with objective patterns of coherence preservation.
