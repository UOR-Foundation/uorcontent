# Signal Compression

A framework for representing signals in compressed form by optimizing prime coordinate representations to preserve essential information structure while reducing representational complexity.

Signal compression in the UOR framework operates on fundamentally different principles than traditional compression techniques. Rather than exploiting statistical redundancy or perceptual limitations, UOR compression optimizes the prime coordinate representation to create compact digests that preserve the essential information structure.

The key insight is that many signals can be represented more efficiently in prime coordinates, where their intrinsic structure becomes apparent. By identifying and preserving this structure while eliminating non-essential aspects, UOR enables compression that maintains the signal's coherence properties.

Signal compression in UOR is based on several key insights: Structure-Preserving Compression that preserves the essential structural relationships within the signal; Prime Coordinate Optimization where the prime factorization representation provides a natural basis for identifying essential vs. non-essential components; and Coherence-Based Reduction where compression decisions are guided by coherence metrics rather than arbitrary thresholds.

For a signal S with prime coordinate representation φ(S), define a compression operator K that produces a compact digest representation: K(φ(S)) = φ'(S), where φ'(S) is a reduced prime coordinate representation that satisfies: d(φ(S), φ'(S)) < ε. Here, d is a coherence-preserving distance metric and ε is the maximum allowed deviation in essential structure. The compression ratio r is given by: r = |φ'(S)| / |φ(S)|, where |·| measures the representational complexity.

The compression process involves several steps: Prime Decomposition converting the signal to its prime coordinate representation; Structural Analysis identifying the essential structural components based on coherence metrics; Coordinate Reduction removing or combining non-essential components while preserving structural relationships; and Digest Formation creating a compact representation that encodes the essential structure.

UOR signal compression enables several unique capabilities: Lossless Semantic Compression that preserves semantic meaning while reducing representational complexity; Adaptive Precision that adjusts precision based on the intrinsic information content rather than arbitrary bit allocations; Cross-Domain Compatibility with compressed representations that maintain compatibility across different domains and applications; and Structure-Preserving Archiving for long-term storage that preserves essential information structure despite format changes.

Signal compression in the UOR framework can be applied to diverse types of signals across different domains. In digital media, it enables efficient representation of audio, video, and image data while preserving perceptual quality. In scientific computing, it allows compact storage of complex simulation results while maintaining analytical utility. In communications systems, it facilitates efficient transmission of data with minimal bandwidth requirements.

Unlike traditional compression algorithms that operate on specific data formats or exploit domain-specific properties, UOR compression provides a unified approach that can be applied consistently across different data types and application domains. This universality stems from the fact that UOR compression operates on the intrinsic prime coordinate structure rather than surface-level statistical properties.

UOR compression differs from traditional approaches in several key ways: Focus on Structure vs. Redundancy - Traditional algorithms primarily exploit statistical redundancy, while UOR preserves structural relationships; Coherence Preservation - UOR maintains the coherence properties of the signal, ensuring that essential information is preserved; Adaptive Optimization - The compression process adapts to the intrinsic structure of each signal rather than applying fixed encoding schemes; Domain Independence - The same fundamental approach works across different types of signals without domain-specific adaptations; Semantic Preservation - UOR compression preserves the semantic meaning of signals, not just their syntactic representation.

The effectiveness of UOR compression can be quantified using several metrics: Compression Ratio - The ratio of the original representation size to the compressed representation size; Coherence Preservation - The degree to which essential structural relationships are maintained, measured by the coherence distance metric; Semantic Fidelity - The preservation of semantic meaning and utility for downstream applications; Computational Efficiency - The computational resources required to perform compression and decompression operations; Cross-Domain Consistency - The consistency of compression performance across different types of signals and application domains.

Signal compression builds on the Coherence Norm and Universal Transforms concepts, while relying on the Information Preservation principle to ensure that essential structure is maintained through the compression process. It provides a practical mechanism for efficient signal representation and storage, while also demonstrating how the abstract mathematical principles of UOR translate into concrete applications with significant practical utility.
