# Intrinsic Primes

## Description

The fundamental building blocks of the [[uor-c-001|UOR framework]], serving as the irreducible elements from which all objects are composed and forming the basis for unique object representation.

[[uor-c-307|Intrinsic primes]] form the fundamental building blocks of the [[uor-c-001|UOR framework]], serving as the irreducible elements from which all objects are composed.

An element p in a domain D is called an intrinsic prime if it satisfies these conditions: Irreducibility, where p cannot be expressed as a product of two non-unit elements in D; Non-unit status, where p is not a unit (invertible element) in D; and the Prime property, where if p divides a product ab, then p divides either a or b.

[[uor-c-307|Intrinsic primes]] possess several critical features that make them suitable as a coordinate basis: Domain independence, as the concept generalizes across number systems, polynomials, and abstract domains; Uniqueness, where each prime represents a distinct, indivisible aspect of object structure; and Completeness, as the set of all primes is sufficient to express any object through composition.

Within the Universal Object Reference framework, [[uor-c-307|intrinsic primes]] serve as: Coordinate axes, where each prime defines an independent dimension in object space; Information atoms, representing the smallest units of structural information; and Spectral components, functioning as fundamental frequencies in an object's composition.

This prime foundation ensures that every object has a canonical decomposition into its most basic constituents, enabling unambiguous reference and comparison across observer frames.
