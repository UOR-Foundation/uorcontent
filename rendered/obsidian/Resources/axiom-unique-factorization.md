# Unique Factorization Axiom

## Description

The second core UOR axiom stating that every non-unit object admits a finite product decomposition into primes, and this decomposition is unique up to reordering of factors.

Every non‑unit object admits a finite product decomposition into primes, and this decomposition is unique up to reordering of factors.

The [[uor-c-301|Unique Factorization]] axiom ensures that any object in the universe can be decomposed into a unique combination of [[uor-c-307|intrinsic primes]]. This profound property establishes that every object has a singular, [[uor-c-004|canonical representation]] in terms of its most fundamental components.

This axiom is the universal extension of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, which states that every positive integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a unique product of prime numbers (up to their order). The [[uor-c-001|UOR framework]] extends this principle to arbitrary domains, creating a universal language for describing structure.

Key insights include: Structural Fingerprint, where [[uor-c-301|unique factorization]] provides each object with a distinctive "fingerprint" - its prime signature - that uniquely identifies it; [[uor-c-004|Canonical Representation]], where UFD guarantees the existence of a single, objective way to decompose any object, eliminating ambiguity in structural analysis; and Isomorphism Foundation, where this axiom enables the faithful mapping between objects and their coordinate representations, preserving all structural information.

In a [[uor-c-301|unique factorization]] domain (UFD) D, every non-zero non-unit element x ∈ D can be expressed as: x = p₁ × p₂ × ... × pₙ where each pᵢ is a prime in D. Furthermore, this representation is unique up to reordering and multiplication by units.

This axiom builds directly on the [[uor-c-307|Intrinsic Primes]] axiom and serves as the foundation for the Prime-Coordinate Homomorphism. [[uor-c-301|Unique factorization]] is what allows the homomorphism to be well-defined and injective, enabling the consistent mapping of objects to their prime coordinate vectors.
