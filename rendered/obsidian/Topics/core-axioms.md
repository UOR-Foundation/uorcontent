# Eight Core UOR Axioms

The eight core axioms that codify the essential properties ensuring that any Unique Factorization Domain supports a fully coherent, observer-aware, prime-coordinate representation.

The Eight Core UOR Axioms codify the essential properties ensuring that any Unique Factorization Domain (UFD) supports a fully coherent, observer‐aware, prime‐coordinate representation. These axioms act as the logical scaffolding underpinning the entire Prime Framework.

The eight core axioms are: Intrinsic Primes, where a set of atomic elements exists such that no element factors further under composition; Unique Factorization, where every non-unit object admits a finite prime decomposition that is unique up to reordering; Prime-Coordinate Homomorphism, where an injective map φ transforms objects into vectors of prime exponents, converting multiplication to addition; Canonical Representation, where the prime coordinates φ(X) provide a unique, base-independent, frame-invariant encoding that minimizes complexity; Coherence Norm, where a metric on coordinate space proves that prime factorization achieves minimal representational complexity; Coherence Inner Product, where the prime coordinate space forms a Euclidean geometry with orthonormal prime axes; Trilateral Coherence, where every valid description integrates structure (primes), dynamics (transformations), and observer perspective; and Universal Mapping Property, where the prime coordinate map is the canonical bridge between multiplicative structures and additive ones.

These axioms establish a universal coordinate system for arbitrary objects based on their intrinsic structure. By ensuring that objects can be uniquely decomposed and encoded, the framework enables a coherent reference system that remains invariant across observer frames while capturing all essential structural information.

The power of this axiomatic foundation lies in its ability to unify diverse mathematical domains under a single coherent framework, providing a common language for representing and analyzing structure across disciplines.
