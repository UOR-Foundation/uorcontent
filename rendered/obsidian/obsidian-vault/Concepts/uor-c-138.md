# Factorization Theorem

The fundamental theorem that states every non-zero non-unit element in a [[uor-c-301|unique factorization]] domain can be expressed as a product of irreducible elements (primes) in an essentially unique way.

## Mathematical Formulation

$
\forall x \in D, x \neq 0, x \text{ not a unit} \implies x = u \cdot p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot p_n
$

$
\text{where } u \text{ is a unit, each } p_i \text{ is prime, and the factorization is unique up to reordering and units}
$
