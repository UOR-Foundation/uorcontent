# Meaning Coherence Field

A field-theoretic structure on semantic prime spaces that quantifies the coherence and consistency of meaning representations across contexts and observer frames.

## Definition

The [[uor-c-320|Meaning Coherence Field]] extends the UOR [[uor-c-005|coherence norm]] concept to create a comprehensive field-theoretic structure for analyzing semantic relationships. This field quantifies how coherently different meanings relate to each other across contexts and [[uor-c-006|observer reference frames]].

At its foundation, the [[uor-c-320|Meaning Coherence Field]] assigns a coherence measure to any pair of meaning representations. This measure calculates how closely aligned two meanings are in the semantic prime coordinate space. Mathematically, this appears as a correlation function or distance metric between prime decompositions, weighted by contextual relevance factors.

The field exhibits several important properties that emerge from UOR principles:

1. Locality: Semantically related meanings have high coherence values
2. Transitivity: Coherence partially transfers across chains of related meanings
3. Context-sensitivity: Coherence values transform predictably across [[uor-c-006|observer reference frames]]
4. Minimality: The most coherent meanings tend toward canonical representations with minimal complexity

The [[uor-c-320|Meaning Coherence Field]] enables powerful analytical approaches to semantic problems. It can identify clusters of related meanings, reveal conceptual tensions or contradictions, and guide the resolution of semantic ambiguities. By quantifying the 'semantic distance' between different meanings, it provides a rigorous framework for mapping semantic spaces.

This field structure also connects the UOR approach to meaning with quantum field theories, information geometry, and category-theoretic models. The coherence measure functions analogously to a correlation function in quantum field theory or a categorical enrichment structure, suggesting deep connections between meaning and fundamental physical and mathematical structures.

## Mathematical Formulation

$
\mathcal{C}(M_1, M_2) = \exp\left(-\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{(\alpha_i - \beta_i)^2}{\sigma_i^2}\right) \text{ where } M_1 = \prod p_i^{\alpha_i} \text{ and } M_2 = \prod p_i^{\beta_i}
$
