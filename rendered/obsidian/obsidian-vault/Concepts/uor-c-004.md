# Canonical Representation

The unique, basis-independent representation of an object using [[uor-c-302|prime coordinates]] that reveals its inherent structure and is invariant across observer frames.

## Definition

A fundamental principle of UOR is that every object has a unique, [[uor-c-004|canonical representation]] that is independent of basis, numeral system, or observer frame. Unlike conventional number representations (binary, decimal, etc.), the prime-coordinate representation is intrinsic to the object itself. The [[uor-c-004|canonical representation]] satisfies several crucial properties: uniqueness, completeness, and invariance. Among all possible representations of an object, the canonical prime-coordinate form minimizes the [[uor-c-005|coherence norm]], provides the most efficient encoding, and contains no redundant information. While [[uor-c-006|observer reference frames]] may interpret the representation differently, the underlying prime structure remains objective.
