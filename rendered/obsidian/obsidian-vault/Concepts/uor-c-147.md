# Canonical Factorization

The standard form for expressing any non-zero non-unit element in a [[uor-c-301|Unique Factorization]] Domain as a product of a unit and prime powers, with distinct primes and finite exponents.

## Mathematical Formulation

$
x = u \cdot p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_n^{e_n}
$

$
\text{where:}
$

$
u \text{ is a unit in } D
$

$
p_i \text{ are distinct primes in } D
$

$
e_i \text{ are exponents (valuations) of primes } p_i
$

$
\text{the product is finite (only finitely many primes have non-zero exponents)}
$
