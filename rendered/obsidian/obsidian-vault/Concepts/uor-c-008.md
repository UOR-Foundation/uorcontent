# Spectral Interpretation

A perspective that reframes prime factorization as a frequency domain analysis, viewing mathematical objects through their prime frequency components.

## Definition

The [[uor-c-008|spectral interpretation]] of UOR reframes prime factorization as a frequency domain analysis, providing a powerful analogy to signal processing and harmonic analysis. This perspective reveals deep structural patterns by viewing objects through the lens of their prime frequency components. The [[uor-c-008|spectral interpretation]] begins with a formal analogy between [[uor-c-002|prime decomposition]] and frequency analysis, including an isomorphism between multiplicative and additive structures, a [[uor-c-009|spectral transform]] that converts between them, and a [[uor-c-304|spectral basis]] where each prime represents a fundamental frequency mode.

## Mathematical Formulation

$
φ: (ℕ₊, ×) → (⨁_p ℕ, +)
$
