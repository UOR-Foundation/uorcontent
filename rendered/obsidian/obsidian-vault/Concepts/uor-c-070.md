# Temporal Prime Element

An irreducible dynamical pattern that serves as a fundamental building block for time-dependent processes in the Universal Object Reference framework.

## Definition

A [[uor-c-070|temporal prime element]] p_T is defined as an irreducible dynamical pattern that satisfies:

1. It cannot be factored into a product of simpler temporal patterns
2. It possesses a characteristic timescale Ï„_p
3. It has a well-defined action on the prime coordinate space

The set of all temporal primes is denoted P_T.

Temporal primes represent irreducible patterns of change that cannot be further factored in the temporal domain. They capture the fundamental modes of a system's evolution across multiple timescales, from rapid fluctuations to long-term evolutionary trends.

## Mathematical Formulation

$
\text{A temporal prime element } p_T \text{ is defined as an irreducible dynamical pattern that satisfies:}
$

$
\text{1. It cannot be factored into a product of simpler temporal patterns}
$

$
\text{2. It possesses a characteristic timescale } \tau_p
$

$
\text{3. It has a well-defined action on the prime coordinate space}
$

$
\text{The set of all temporal primes is denoted } P_T.
