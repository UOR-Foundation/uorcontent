# Compression Definition

The formal definition and conceptual foundation of signal compression within the [[uor-c-001|UOR framework]], based on prime coordinate optimization and structure preservation.

## Definition

Signal compression in the [[uor-c-001|UOR framework]] operates on fundamentally different principles than traditional compression techniques. Rather than exploiting statistical redundancy or perceptual limitations, UOR compression optimizes the prime coordinate representation to create compact digests that preserve the essential information structure.

For a signal `S` with prime coordinate representation `φ(S)`, define a compression operator `K` that produces a compact digest representation: `K(φ(S)) = φ'(S)`

Where `φ'(S)` is a reduced prime coordinate representation that satisfies: `d(φ(S), φ'(S)) < ε`

Here, `d` is a coherence-preserving distance metric and `ε` is the maximum allowed deviation in essential structure.

The compression ratio `r` is given by: `r = |φ'(S)| / |φ(S)|`

Where `|·|` measures the representational complexity.

## Mathematical Formulation

$
\text{Signal compression in UOR is defined as a transformation from a signal's prime}
$

$
\text{coordinate representation to a compact digest that preserves essential structure.}
$

$
\text{For a signal } S \text{ with prime coordinate representation } \phi(S):
$

$
\text{The compression operator } K \text{ produces a compact digest:}
$

$
K: \phi(S) \mapsto \phi'(S)
$

$
\text{Where } \phi'(S) \text{ is a reduced prime coordinate representation that satisfies:}
$

$
d(\phi(S), \phi'(S)) < \varepsilon
$

$
\text{Here, } d \text{ is a coherence-preserving distance metric and } \varepsilon \text{ is the}
$

$
\text{maximum allowed deviation in essential structure.}
$

$
\text{The compression ratio } r \text{ is given by:}
$

$
r = \frac{|\phi'(S)|}{|\phi(S)|}
$

$
\text{Where } |\cdot| \text{ measures the representational complexity.}
$

$
\text{The essence of UOR compression is captured by the following axiom:}
$

$
\text{For any signal } S \text{, there exists a compact representation } \phi'(S) \text{ such that:}
$

$
\forall f \in \mathcal{F}_{\text{essential}}: |f(\phi(S)) - f(\phi'(S))| < \delta_f
$

$
\text{Where } \mathcal{F}_{\text{essential}} \text{ is the set of essential structural features and}
$

$
\delta_f \text{ is the acceptable deviation for feature } f\text{.}
$
