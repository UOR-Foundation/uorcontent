# Coherence Measure Types

Different mathematical formulations of coherence that generate distinct classes of coherence-preserving dynamics based on information, structure, function, and relationships.

## Definition

Different coherence measures generate different classes of coherence-preserving dynamics:

Information-Theoretic Coherence: Based on mutual information between past and present states:

C_I(φ(t), φ_0) = I(φ(t); φ_0)

Preserving this coherence maintains the information content shared between current and reference states.

Structural Coherence: Based on structural similarity in prime coordinate space:

C_S(φ(t), φ_0) = exp(-(‖φ(t) - φ_0‖²)/(2σ²))

Preserving this coherence maintains the geometric structure of the prime coordinate representation.

Functional Coherence: Based on preservation of functional relationships:

C_F(φ(t), φ_0) = corr(f(φ(t)), f(φ_0))

Where f maps the prime coordinate representation to some functional output space.

Preserving this coherence maintains the functional behavior of the system, even if its internal structure changes.

Relational Coherence: Based on preservation of relationships between components:

C_R(φ(t), φ_0) = sim(R(φ(t)), R(φ_0))

Where R extracts the relational structure between components of the system.

Preserving this coherence maintains the pattern of relationships, even as the components themselves may change.

## Mathematical Formulation

$
\text{Different coherence measures generate different classes of coherence-preserving dynamics:}
$

$
\text{1. Information-Theoretic Coherence:}
$

$
C_I(\phi(t), \phi_0) = I(\phi(t); \phi_0)
$

$
\text{   Based on mutual information between past and present states.}
$

$
\text{2. Structural Coherence:}
$

$
C_S(\phi(t), \phi_0) = \exp\left(-\frac{\|\phi(t) - \phi_0\|^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
$

$
\text{   Based on structural similarity in prime coordinate space.}
$

$
\text{3. Functional Coherence:}
$

$
C_F(\phi(t), \phi_0) = \text{corr}(f(\phi(t)), f(\phi_0))
$

$
\text{   Where } f \text{ maps the prime coordinate representation to a functional output space.}
$

$
\text{4. Relational Coherence:}
$

$
C_R(\phi(t), \phi_0) = \text{sim}(R(\phi(t)), R(\phi_0))
$

$
\text{   Where } R \text{ extracts the relational structure between components.}
$
