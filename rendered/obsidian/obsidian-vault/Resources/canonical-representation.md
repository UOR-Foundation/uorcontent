# Canonical Representation

An explanation of how UOR provides a unique, basis-independent, [[uor-c-004|canonical representation]] for any object.

A fundamental principle of UOR is that every object has a unique, [[uor-c-004|canonical representation]] that is independent of basis, numeral system, or observer frame.

Unlike conventional number representations (binary, decimal, etc.), the prime-coordinate representation is intrinsic to the object itself:

- Not tied to any particular numeral base
- Independent of arbitrary encoding choices
- Reveals the object's inherent structure rather than human-imposed format

The [[uor-c-004|canonical representation]] satisfies several crucial properties:

- Uniqueness: Each object maps to exactly one prime-coordinate representation
- Completeness: All properties of the object can be recovered from its representation
- Invariance: The representation remains unchanged under permissible transformations

Among all possible representations of an object, the canonical prime-coordinate form:

- Minimizes the [[uor-c-005|coherence norm]]
- Provides the most efficient encoding (minimum description length)
- Contains no redundant information

While [[uor-c-006|observer reference frames]] may interpret the representation differently, the underlying prime structure remains objective:

- Different frames observe the same intrinsic [[uor-c-002|prime decomposition]]
- [[uor-c-018|Frame transformations]] preserve the canonical structure
- All valid observers agree on the factorization, even with different perspectives

This [[uor-c-004|canonical representation]] forms the foundation for UOR's ability to provide unambiguous reference across disparate domains and observer perspectives.
