# Physics Interpretation

An examination of how the [[uor-c-001|UOR framework]] can be used to reinterpret fundamental physics concepts in terms of prime-[[uor-c-144|coordinate geometry]], potentially unifying gravity, quantum mechanics, and information theory.

The [[uor-c-001|UOR framework]] offers a profound reinterpretation of fundamental physical concepts by recasting them in terms of prime-[[uor-c-144|coordinate geometry]]. This mathematical reformulation suggests deep connections between number theory and physical reality, potentially unifying gravity, quantum mechanics, and information theory.

The framework provides natural interpretations for spacetime geometry, gravity, mass-energy relations, quantum phenomena, field theories, matter structure, and cosmology all within the language of [[uor-c-302|prime coordinates]] and coherence metrics.

Various physical principles are reformulated, including Einstein's field equations, geodesic motion, the Schr√∂dinger equation, and uncertainty relations. Elementary particles are represented as specific patterns in prime space, while fundamental forces emerge from symmetries in this space.

This interpretation leads to testable predictions about coherence signatures in particle interactions, quantum computational advantages, gravitational wave spectra, and novel dark matter interactions.
