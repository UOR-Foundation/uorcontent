# Formal Supplement

A formal mathematical supplement to the [[uor-c-001|UOR framework]] providing rigorous category-theoretic, sheaf-theoretic, and domain-theoretic extensions and formalizations.

The Formal Supplement provides rigorous mathematical formalizations and extensions of the [[uor-c-001|UOR framework]] across several advanced domains of mathematics.

Beginning with the [[uor-c-301|Unique Factorization]] Domain (UFD) Axiom, it formalizes the core requirement that every non-unit object in category ùí∞ admits a unique finite decomposition into irreducible objects (primes). This axiom establishes the foundation for the entire [[uor-c-001|UOR framework]].

The Category-Theoretic Formalization models ùí∞ as a monoidal category with composition as the tensor product. It defines the [[uor-c-142|prime coordinate map]] œÜ as a strong monoidal functor from (ùí∞,‚àò,1) to (‚Ñ§^(P),+,0), which preserves tensor and unit. This functor is initial among all such homomorphisms, exhibiting a universal property where any other functor to an abelian group factors uniquely through œÜ.

From a Sheaf & Stack Perspective, observers form a fibered category (stack) over ùí∞, assigning to each object X the groupoid of frames R. The canonical frame section exhibits the total category as a trivial torsor, ensuring global coherence and flatness of the bundle.

The framework extends to Dedekind Domains lacking [[uor-c-301|unique factorization]] by refining primes to prime ideals. Working in the category of fractional ideals restores the UFD axiom, with the UOR coordinate extending to the ideal class group.

Additional concepts include Base-Absolute [[uor-c-302|Prime Coordinates]] (independent of any chosen basis or chart), Primary Decomposition in Modules (generalizing prime factorization for modules over Noetherian rings), and Universal Properties & Limits of UOR (showing that œÜ enjoys a [[uor-c-028|universal mapping property]]).

Finally, the supplement presents case studies in pure mathematics, demonstrating the application of UOR concepts to polynomial rings, algebraic number theory, and group representation theory.
