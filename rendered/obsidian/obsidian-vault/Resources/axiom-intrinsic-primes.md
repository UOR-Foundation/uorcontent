# Intrinsic Primes Axiom

The first core UOR axiom stating that a set of atomic elements exists such that no element factors further under composition in the domain, establishing the fundamental building blocks of structure.

A set P of atomic elements exists such that no element in P factors further under composition in the domain.

[[uor-c-307|Intrinsic primes]] form the fundamental alphabet of reality. They are the irreducible elements that cannot be further decomposed within their domain, serving as the building blocks for all composite structures.

This axiom establishes that in any domain with a composition operation, there exist fundamental entities that cannot be broken down further. These entities are the "atoms" of the domain, from which everything else is built.

Key insights include: Domain Universality, where while the exact identity of primes varies across domains (numbers, polynomials, sets, etc.), the concept of irreducible elements is universal; Foundational Necessity, where without [[uor-c-307|intrinsic primes]], there would be no "bottom level" to structure, leading to infinite regression in decomposition; and Information Basis, where primes represent the elementary units of information about an object's structure, establishing the fundamental dimensions of the object space.

In a monoid (M, ◦) with identity e, an element p ∈ M is prime if: p ≠ e (not the identity element), and if p = a ◦ b then either a = e or b = e (irreducibility).

The [[uor-c-307|Intrinsic Primes]] axiom serves as the foundation for the [[uor-c-301|Unique Factorization]] axiom, which ensures that every object has a unique decomposition into these prime elements. Together, they establish the basis for the Prime-Coordinate Homomorphism, mapping objects to their unique prime signature.
