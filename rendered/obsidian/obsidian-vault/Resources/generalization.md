# UOR Generalization

The generalization of the Universal Object Reference framework to various mathematical domains beyond integer factorization.

The [[uor-c-001|UOR framework]] can be generalized to various mathematical domains beyond integer factorization.

Theorem ([[uor-c-031|General UOR Existence]]): Let D be any UFD (or GCD domain satisfying factorization axioms). Then the prime-coordinate functor φ: D^× → ℤ^P is well-defined, exact, and admits an extension to polynomial rings D[x], localizations D_S, and formal power series D[[x]], preserving [[uor-c-301|unique factorization]] in each case.

Concretely, UOR applies whenever a domain admits a notion of irreducible generators P and a UFD-like factorization property. Key examples include:

- Polynomial Rings D[x]: Irreducible monic polynomials in D[x] serve as primes; φ encodes factor degrees and coefficients via multi-index valuations.

- Combinatorial Monoids: In incidence algebras, connected components decompose uniquely, with φ capturing component counts.

- Localization & Sheaf Domains: Local UFDs obtained via inverting primes (e.g. local rings at maximal ideals) carry local φ maps, gluing into sheaves over Spec(D).

In each context, φ remains injective, multiplicative-additive, and coherence‑minimizing, yielding a universal coordinate atlas. This universality hints at a grander vision: UOR as a spectrum-level invariant extending beyond first-order domains into derived categories, spectral stacks, and even the realm of homotopy types, where "primes" become indecomposable objects and φ a homotopical coordinate functor.
