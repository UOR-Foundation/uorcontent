# Observer Reference Frames

An explanation of how the [[uor-c-001|UOR framework]] incorporates observer perspectives through the principle of [[uor-c-017|trilateral coherence]].

The [[uor-c-001|UOR framework]] incorporates observer perspectives through the principle of [[uor-c-017|trilateral coherence]], ensuring that object descriptions remain consistent across different reference frames.

Every coherent description of an object must incorporate and harmonize three aspects:

1. Intrinsic Structure: The object's canonical [[uor-c-002|prime decomposition]]
2. Dynamical Rules: The composition laws governing object interactions
3. Observer Frame: The perspective from which the object is described

These three elements form an indivisible triad - changing any one necessitates adjustments in the others to maintain a coherent description.

The mathematical formalism for observer perspectives employs a frame bundle:

- Each point in the bundle corresponds to a specific (object, observer) pair
- The projection map extracts the intrinsic object structure independent of observer
- [[uor-c-018|Frame transformations]] allow translation between different observer perspectives
- A global section of this bundle defines a consistent choice of observer for all objects

Transformations between observer frames must preserve certain invariants:

- The intrinsic [[uor-c-002|prime decomposition]] remains unchanged
- The [[uor-c-152|coherence metric]] might transform, but preserves minimality properties
- Composition laws maintain their algebraic structure across frames
- Physical quantities transform according to appropriate representation rules

Certain properties remain invariant across all valid observer frames:

- The cardinality of the [[uor-c-002|prime decomposition]] (number of distinct prime factors)
- The essential factorization pattern (which primes appear, if not their exact representation)
- The algebraic relationships between composed objects
- The topological features of the prime-coordinate space

Through [[uor-c-016|observer coherence]], UOR provides a framework for understanding how intrinsic mathematical structure relates to the perspectives from which it is observed and described.
