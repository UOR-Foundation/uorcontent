The [[uor-c-005|Coherence Norm]] Axiom resource establishes how this axiom works directly with the Prime-Coordinate Homomorphism, underpins the [[uor-c-004|Canonical Representation]] by providing the metric for representational minimality, and sets the stage for the [[uor-c-308|Coherence Inner Product]], serving as a bridging element within the [[uor-c-001|UOR framework]]
