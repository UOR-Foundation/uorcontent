# establishes

The [[uor-c-028|Universal Mapping Property]] Axiom resource establishes how this axiom connects to all other core axioms, confirming [[uor-c-307|intrinsic primes]] as fundamental building blocks, depending on [[uor-c-301|unique factorization]], elevating the prime-coordinate homomorphism to canonical status, providing theoretical justification for [[uor-c-004|canonical representation]], aligning with coherence metrics, and supporting [[uor-c-017|trilateral coherence]]

## Predicate: establishes

**Value:** establishes the connections between the Universal Mapping Property Axiom and other core axioms
