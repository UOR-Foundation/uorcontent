# models biological and medical systems

Relation indicating that a resource models biological and medical systems through prime-coordinate principles

## Predicate: models biological and medical systems

**Value:** The resource applies prime-coordinate principles to biological and medical systems, demonstrating how living organisms optimize information processing through genomic prime structure (DNA sequences manifesting patterns that optimize information density), protein folding energy landscapes (following coherence minimization principles), diagnostic prime signatures (disease states exhibiting characteristic deviations in prime-coordinate patterns), and metabolic network optimization (cellular metabolism modeled as coherence optimization in reaction networks).
