# develops sheaf perspective

Relation indicating that a resource develops a sheaf and stack theoretic perspective on the [[uor-c-001|UOR framework]]

## Predicate: develops sheaf perspective

**Value:** The resource develops a sophisticated sheaf and stack theoretic perspective on the UOR framework, showing how observers form a fibered category over the base category with objects as (object, frame) pairs, and how the canonical frame section exhibits the total category as a trivial torsor ensuring global coherence.
