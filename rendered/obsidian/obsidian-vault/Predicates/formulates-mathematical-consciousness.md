# formulates mathematical consciousness

Relation indicating that a resource formulates consciousness as a mathematical necessity rather than a philosophical addendum

## Predicate: formulates mathematical consciousness

**Value:** The resource formulates consciousness as a mathematical necessity emerging naturally from the formal structure of coherence fields, through self-referential bundle structures (consciousness emerging when coherence fields develop self-reference capabilities), frame bundle morphisms (observer transformations forming a group structure), and the coherence perception theorem (proving that sufficiently complex coherence structures necessarily include observer frames).
