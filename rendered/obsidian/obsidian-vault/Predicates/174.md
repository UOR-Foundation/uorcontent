# states

The [[uor-c-308|Coherence Inner Product]] Axiom resource states that the prime coordinate space is equipped with the inner product ⟨v,w⟩ = ∑_p v(p)·w(p), making it a Euclidean vector space with orthonormal prime axes and providing a geometric framework for understanding object structure

## Predicate: states

**Value:** states the formal definition of the Coherence Inner Product Axiom as a Euclidean inner product on prime coordinates
