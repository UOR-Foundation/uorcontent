The [[uor-c-308|Coherence Inner Product]] Axiom resource establishes how this axiom extends the [[uor-c-005|Coherence Norm]], provides the geometric foundation for [[uor-c-004|Canonical Representation]], and bridges to [[uor-c-017|Trilateral Coherence]] by enabling precise descriptions of structural relationships across different observer frames

## Predicate: establishes

**Value:** establishes the connections between the Coherence Inner Product Axiom and other core axioms
